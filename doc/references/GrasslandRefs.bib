  abstract = {In order to predict which ecosystem functions are most at risk from biodiversity loss, meta-analyses have generalised results from biodiversity experiments over different sites and ecosystem types. In contrast, comparing the strength of biodiversity effects across a large number of ecosystem processes measured in a single experiment permits more direct comparisons. Here, we present an analysis of 418 separate measures of 38 ecosystem processes. Overall, 45~\% of processes were significantly affected by plant species richness, suggesting that, while diversity affects a large number of processes not all respond to biodiversity. We therefore compared the strength of plant diversity effects between different categories of ecosystem processes, grouping processes according to the year of measurement, their biogeochemical cycle, trophic level and compartment (above- or belowground) and according to whether they were measures of biodiversity or other ecosystem processes, biotic or abiotic and static or dynamic. Overall, and for several individual processes, we found that biodiversity effects became stronger over time. Measures of the carbon cycle were also affected more strongly by plant species richness than were the measures associated with the nitrogen cycle. Further, we found greater plant species richness effects on measures of biodiversity than on other processes. The differential effects of plant diversity on the various types of ecosystem processes indicate that future research and political effort should shift from a general debate about whether biodiversity loss impairs ecosystem functions to focussing on the specific functions of interest and ways to preserve them individually or in combination.},

  abstract = {Although temporal heterogeneity is a well-accepted driver of biodiversity, effects of interannual variation in land-use intensity (LUI) have not been addressed yet. Additionally, responses to land use can differ greatly among different organisms; therefore, overall effects of land-use on total local biodiversity are hardly known. To test for effects of LUI (quantified as the combined intensity of fertilization, grazing, and mowing) and interannual variation in LUI (SD in LUI across time), we introduce a unique measure of whole-ecosystem biodiversity, multidiversity. This synthesizes individual diversity measures across up to 49 taxonomic groups of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria from 150 grasslands. Multidiversity declined with increasing LUI among grasslands, particularly for rarer species and aboveground organisms, whereas common species and belowground groups were less sensitive. However, a high level of interannual variation in LUI increased overall multidiversity at low LUI and was even more beneficial for rarer species because it slowed the rate at which the multidiversity of rare species declined with increasing LUI. In more intensively managed grasslands, the diversity of rarer species was, on average, 18\% of the maximum diversity across all grasslands when LUI was static over time but increased to 31\% of the maximum when LUI changed maximally over time. In addition to decreasing overall LUI, we suggest varying LUI across years as a complementary strategy to promote biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Global change, especially land-use intensification, affects human well-being by impacting the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (multifunctionality). However, whether biodiversity loss is a major component of global change effects on multifunctionality in real-world ecosystems, as in experimental ones, remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional composition and 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We also introduce five multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according to realistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodiversity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average. Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explained indirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-use objectives favoured supporting and cultural services. In contrast, functional composition shifts, towards fast-growing plant species, strongly increased provisioning services in more inherently unproductive grasslands.},

  abstract = {Rare species reintroductions are an increasingly common conservation strategy, but often result in poor survival of reintroduced individuals. Reintroduction sites are chosen primarily based on historical occupancy and/or abiotic properties of the site, with much less consideration given to properties of the larger biotic community. However, ecological niche theory suggests that the ability to coexist with other species is determined in part by the degree of functional similarity between species. The degree to which functional similarity affects the survival of reintroduced plants is poorly understood, but has important implications for the allocation of limited conservation resources. We collected a suite of abiotic, biotic and functional trait variables centered on outplanted individuals from four reintroduced rare plant species and used logistic regression and model selection to assess their influence on individual survival. We show that higher functional similarity between reintroduced individuals and the local community, measured by differences between their multivariate functional traits and the community weighted mean traits of their immediate neighbors, increases survival and is a stronger predictor of survival than local variation in abiotic factors, suggesting that the functional composition of the biotic community should be incorporated into site selection to improve reintroduction success.},

Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of beta diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in beta diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in beta diversity.},

However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g., spatiotemporal modeling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur simultaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the last 16 yr. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.},

Reconstructing historical changes in human-derived fire regimes empirically is challenging, but information is available on the timing of key human innovations and on current human impacts on fire; here we incorporate this knowledge into a spatially explicit fire propagation model. We explore how changes in population density, the ability to create fire, and the expansion of agropastoralism altered the extent and seasonal distribution of fire as modern humans arose and spread through Africa. Much emphasis has been placed on the positive effect of population density on ignition frequency, but our model suggests this is less important than changes in fire spread and connectivity that would have occurred as humans learned to light fires in the dry season and to transform the landscape through grazing and cultivation. Different landscapes show different limitations; we show that substantial human impacts on burned area would only have started \textasciitilde 4,000 B.P. in open landscapes, whereas they could have altered fire regimes in closed/dissected landscapes by \textasciitilde 40,000 B.P. Dry season fires have been the norm for the past 200-300 ky across all landscapes. The annual area burned in Africa probably peaked between 4 and 40 kya. These results agree with recent paleocarbon studies that suggest that the biomass burned today is less than in the recent past in subtropical countries.},

To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic because fire is multidimensional, and focus on a single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this, we identified five key characteristics of fire regimes--size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent--and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correlations demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire characteristics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm identified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass-fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of a fifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered modifications to fire characteristics. Differing biomes and climates may be represented within the same pyrome, implying that pathways of change in future fire regimes in response to changes in climate and human activity may be difficult to predict.},

  abstract = {Human impacts on fire regimes accumulated slowly with the evolution of modern humans able to ignite fires and manipulate landscapes. Today, myriad voices aim to influence fire in grassy ecosystems to different ends, and this is complicated by a colonial past focused on suppressing fire and preventing human ignitions. Here, I review available evidence on the impacts of people on various fire characteristics such as the number and size of fires, fire intensity, fire frequency and seasonality of fire in African grassy ecosystems, with the intention of focusing the debate and identifying areas of uncertainty. Humans alter seasonal patterns of fire in grassy systems but tend to decrease total fire emissions: livestock have replaced fire as the dominant consumer in many parts of Africa, and fragmented landscapes reduce area burned. Humans alter the season and time of day when fires occur, with important implications for fire intensity, tree-grass dynamics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Late season fires are more common when fire is banned or illegal: these later fires are far more intense but emit fewer GHGs. The types of fires which preserve human livelihoods and biodiversity are not always aligned with the goal of reducing GHG concentrations. Current fire management challenges therefore involve balancing the needs of a large rural population against national and global perspectives on the desirability of different types of fire, but this cannot happen unless the interests of all parties are equally represented. In the future, Africa is expected to urbanize and land use to intensify, which will imply different trajectories for the continent's fire regimes.This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind.},

  abstract = {Empirical knowledge of diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, which makes comparisons across systems difficult to interpret. Here, we show how variability can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities. This requires that we abandon one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values generated by all possible stochastic perturbations. Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns. We conclude that a multidimensional perspective on variability helps reveal the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal enables plants to reach hospitable germination sites and escape natural enemies. Understanding when and how much seed dispersal matters to plant fitness is critical for understanding plant population and community dynamics. At the same time, the complexity of factors that determine if a seed will be successfully dispersed and subsequently develop into a reproductive plant is daunting. Quantifying all factors that may influence seed dispersal effectiveness for any potential seed-vector relationship would require an unrealistically large amount of time, materials and financial resources. On the other hand, being able to make dispersal predictions is critical for predicting whether single species and entire ecosystems will be resilient to global change. Building on current frameworks, we here posit that seed dispersal ecology should adopt plant functional groups as analytical units to reduce this complexity to manageable levels. Functional groups can be used to distinguish, for their constituent species, whether it matters (i) if seeds are dispersed, (ii) into what context they are dispersed and (iii) what vectors disperse them. To avoid overgeneralization, we propose that the utility of these functional groups may be assessed by generating predictions based on the groups and then testing those predictions against species-specific data. We suggest that data collection and analysis can then be guided by robust functional group definitions. Generalizing across similar species in this way could help us to better understand the population and community dynamics of plants and tackle the complexity of seed dispersal as well as its disruption.},

We examined effects of annual and triennial prescribed fires conducted in early spring on soil moisture, temperature, and N, plant growth, and plant N content in semiarid shortgrass steppe. Annual burning increased soil inorganic N availability throughout the growing season, which was associated with increased soil temperature and a reduction in aboveground N in C3 plants. Furthermore, the increase in soil inorganic N pools with annual burning was modest and did not facilitate success of ruderal species. Negative fire effects on C3 plant production could be due to increased soil temperature, reduced soil moisture, or direct negative effects on C3 plant meristems, although fuel loads and fire temperatures were low relative to other grasslands. Triennial burning had intermediate effects on N availability and C3 plant production compared to annual burning and unburned controls. Results show that prescribed burns can be used in the management of this semiarid grassland without facilitating annual plant invasion, but excessively frequent burning can reduce production of C3 plants.},

We examined the influence of patch-burn grazing management, which employs spatiotemporal interactions between fire and livestock grazing guided by historical disturbance patterns, on vegetation structure and bird abundance in shortgrass steppe in northeastern Colorado, USA. All study pastures were grazed by cattle at moderate stocking rates from May to October each year. In the patch-burn treatment, we burned 25\% of each pasture in autumn (Oct or Nov) each year during 2007\textendash 2010; control pastures were not burned. Patch-burn grazing management increased vegetation heterogeneity by generating short ({$<$}4 cm), sparse vegetation on recent burns. Although cattle selectively grazed recent burns, this did not alter vegetation structure in unburned portions of patch-burned pastures relative to controls. Of the 6 grassland bird species we examined, mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) occurred exclusively on recent burns, whereas grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) occurred exclusively in grassland not burned for 3 years. Two species (lark bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys] and western meadowlark [Sturnella neglecta]) were 2\textendash 3 times less abundant on recent burns compared to controls, whereas densities of horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) and McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii) were unaffected by burning. Lark bunting, western meadowlark, and grasshopper sparrow densities varied substantially among years. In the years when they were abundant, all 3 species increased in density across the time-since-burning gradient. Consistent with this pattern, patch-burn grazing management reduced the abundance of all 3 species at the whole-pasture scale. We found no evidence that unburned patches within the patch-burned pastures differed from unburned pastures in terms ofthe abundance ofany bird species. Patch-burn grazing management was an effective strategy to create breeding habitat for mountain plovers. However, our findings suggest that in the shortgrass steppe, additional strategies that generate taller, more dense vegetation than occurs under moderate cattle grazing need to be considered in combination with patch-burn grazing management to sustain breeding habitat for the full suite of native grassland birds.},

We analyzed a database including 15~years of seeding outcomes across 150 sites on the Colorado Plateau, a cold desert ecoregion in the western United States, and analyzed the independent and interactive effects of functional traits (seed mass, height, and specific leaf area) and local biologically-relevant climate variables on seeding success. We predicted that the best models would include an interaction between plant traits and climate, indicating a need to match the right trait value to the right climate conditions to maximize seeding success. Indeed, we found that both plant height and seed size significantly interacted with temperature seasonality, with larger seeds and taller plants performing better in more seasonal environments. We also determined that these trait-environment patterns are not influenced by whether a species is native or non-native. Our results inform the selection of seed mixes for restoring areas with specific climatic conditions, while also demonstrating the strong influence of temperature seasonality on seeding success in the Colorado Plateau region.},

  abstract = {Non-native, invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass-fire cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantified resulting changes in fire activity at local scales, and many have speculated about larger scales, regional alterations to fire regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the influence of large-scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on fire size, duration, spread rate, and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin, USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2000-2009 and to fire extents recorded by the USGS registry of fires from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6\% of the central Great Basin (650 000 km(2) ). MODIS records show that 13\% of these cheatgrass-dominated lands burned, resulting in a fire return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.5-6\% burned). During the 1990s, this difference was even more extreme, with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16\% of cheatgrass burned compared to 1-5\% of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest fires, comprising 24\% of the land area of the 50 largest fires recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore, multi-date fires that burned across multiple vegetation types were significantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally, cheatgrass fires showed a strong interannual response to wet years, a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional fire regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades, this study is the first to document recent cheatgrass-driven fire regimes at a regional scale.},

We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is most often examined by controlling species richness and randomising community composition. In natural systems, biodiversity changes are often part of a bigger community assembly dynamic. Therefore, focusing on community assembly and the functioning of ecosystems (CAFE), by integrating both species richness and composition through species gains, losses and changes in abundance, will better reveal how community changes affect ecosystem function. We synthesise the BEF and CAFE perspectives using an ecological application of the Price equation, which partitions the contributions of richness and composition to function. Using empirical examples, we show how the CAFE approach reveals important contributions of composition to function. These examples show how changes in species richness and composition driven by environmental perturbations can work in concert or antagonistically to influence ecosystem function. Considering how communities change in an integrative fashion, rather than focusing on one axis of community structure at a time, will improve our ability to anticipate and predict changes in ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic and species-based taxonomic descriptions of community structure may provide complementary information about the mechanisms driving community assembly across different environments. Environmental filtering may have similar effects on taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity under the assumption of niche conservatism, whereas competitive exclusion could produce contrasting patterns in these diversity metrics. In grassland restorations, these diversity patterns might then reveal potential assembly mechanisms underlying the impacts of restoration and management conditions on community structure. We compared plant community structure (alpha diversity, composition, and within-site beta diversity) from both phylogenetic and taxonomic perspectives. Using surveys from 120 tallgrass prairie restorations in four regions of the Midwestern United States, we examined the effects of four potential drivers or environmental gradients: precipitation in the first year of restoration, seed mix richness, time since last prescribed fire, and restoration age, and included soil conditions as a covariate. First-year precipitation influenced taxonomic community structure, but had weak effects on phylogenetic diversity and composition. Similarly, greater seed mix richness increased taxonomic diversity but did not influence phylogenetic diversity. Taxonomic, but not phylogenetic, diversity generally was lower in older restorations and those with a longer time since the last prescribed fire. These drivers consistently explained more variation in taxonomic than phylogenetic diversity and composition, perhaps in part because species turnover was largely among related species, producing weak impacts on phylogenetic community measures. An impact of precipitation on taxonomic but not phylogenetic diversity suggests that there may not be large differences in drought tolerance among clades that would cause phylogenetic patterns to arise from this environmental filter. Declining taxonomic diversity but not phylogenetic diversity is consistent with competitive exclusion as an assembly mechanism when competition is strongest between related species. Synthesis. This research shows how studying taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of ecosystem restorations can inform plant community ecology and help natural resource managers better predict the outcomes of restoration actions and management.},

Complementarity is one common explanation for these positive biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationships. Yet, complementarity is often indirectly quantified as overperformance in mixture relative to monoculture (e.g., `complementarity effect'). This overperformance is then attributed to the intuitive idea of complementarity or, more specifically, to species resource partitioning. Locally, however, several unassociated causes may drive this overperformance. Here, we differentiate complementarity into three types of species differences that may cause enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse ecosystems: (i) resource partitioning, (ii) abiotic facilitation, and (iii) biotic feedbacks. We argue that disentangling these three causes is crucial for predicting the response of ecosystems to future biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {Locally, plant species richness supports many ecosystem functions. Yet, the mechanisms driving these often-positive biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationships are not well understood. Spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients is one of the main hypothesized causes for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more biodiverse grasslands. Spatial resource partitioning occurs if species differ in where they acquire resources and can happen both above- and belowground. However, studies investigating spatial resource partitioning in grasslands provide inconsistent evidence. We present the results of a meta-analysis of 21 data sets from experimental species-richness gradients in grasslands. We test the hypothesis that increasing spatial resource partitioning along vertical resource gradients enhances ecosystem functioning in diverse grassland plant communities above- and belowground. To test this hypothesis, we asked three questions. (1) Does species richness enhance biomass production or community resource uptake across sites? (2) Is there evidence of spatial resource partitioning as indicated by resource tracer uptake and biomass allocation above- and belowground? (3) Is evidence of spatial resource partitioning correlated with increased biomass production or community resource uptake? Although plant species richness enhanced community nitrogen and potassium uptake and biomass production above- and belowground, we found that plant communities did not meet our criteria for spatial resource partitioning, though they did invest in significantly more aboveground biomass in higher canopy layers in mixture relative to monoculture. Furthermore, the extent of spatial resource partitioning across studies was not positively correlated with either biomass production or community resource uptake. Our results suggest that spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients alone does not offer a general explanation for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse temperate grasslands.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity is declining at rates faster than at any other point in human history. Experimental manipulations at small spatial scales have demonstrated that communities with fewer species consistently produce less biomass than higher diversity communities. Understanding the consequences of the global extinction crisis for ecosystem functioning requires understanding how local experimental results are likely to change with increasing spatial and temporal scales and from experiments to naturally assembled systems. Scaling across time and space in a changing world requires baseline predictions. Here, we provide a graphical null model for area scaling of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships using observed macroecological patterns: the species area curve and the biomass area curve. We use species-area and biomass-area curves to predict how species richness \textendash{} biomass relationships are likely to change with increasing sampling extent. We then validate these predictions with data from two naturally assembled ecosystems: a Minnesota savanna and a Panamanian tropical dry forest. Our graphical null model predicts that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are scale dependent. However, we note two important caveats. First, our results indicate an apparent contradiction between predictions based on measurements in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments and from scaling theory. When ecosystem functioning is measured as per unit area (e.g., biomass m-2), as is common in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments, the slope of the biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationship should decrease with increasing scale. Alternatively, when ecosystem functioning is not measured per unit area (e.g., summed total biomass), as is common in scaling studies, the slope of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship should increase with increasing spatial scale. Second, the underlying macroecological patterns of biodiversity experiments are predictably different from some naturally assembled systems. These differences between the underlying patterns of experiments and naturally assembled systems may enable us to better understand when patterns from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments will be valid in naturally assembled systems. This paper provides a simple graphical null model that can be extended to any relationship between biodiversity and any ecosystem functioning across space or time. Further, these predictions provide crucial insights into how and when we may be able to extend results from small scale biodiversity experiments to naturally assembled regional and global ecosystems where biodiversity is changing.},

Soils receiving 140\,kg\,N\,ha(-1) per year show a decline in total seed abundance, seed species richness, and the abundance of forbs, sedges and grasses. These results reveal larger effects of N pollution on seed banks than on aboveground vegetation as cover and flowering is not significantly altered for most species. Further, the seed bank shows no recovery 4 years after the cessation of N deposition. These results provide insights into the severe negative effects of N pollution on plant communities that threaten the stability of populations, community persistence and the potential for ecosystems to recover following anthropogenic disturbance or climate change.},

This study evaluated vegetation response to cattle grazing over 7 yr (2007\textendash 2013) on burned Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis [Beetle \& Young] Welsh) steppe in eastern Oregon. Treatments, replicated four times and applied in a randomized complete block design, included no grazing on burned (nonuse) and unburned (control) sagebrush steppe; and cattle grazing at low (low), moderate (moderate), and high (high) stocking on burned sagebrush steppe. Vegetation dynamics were evaluated by quantifying herbaceous (canopy and basal cover, density, production, reproductive shoot weight) and shrub (canopy cover, density) response variables. Aside from basal cover, herbaceous canopy cover, production, and reproduction were not different among low, moderate, and nonuse treatments. Perennial bunchgrass basal cover was about 25\% lower in the low and moderate treatments than the nonuse. Production, reproductive stem weight, and perennial grass basal cover were greater in the low, moderate, and nonuse treatments than the control. The high treatment had lower perennial bunchgrass cover (canopy and basal) and production than other grazed and nonuse treatments. Bunchgrass density remained unchanged in the high treatment, not differing from other treatments, and reproductive effort was comparable to the other treatments, indicating these areas are potentially recoverable by reducing stocking. Cover and production of Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass) did not differ among the grazed and nonuse treatments, though all were greater than the control. Cover and density of A.t. spp. wyomingensis did not differ among the burned grazed and nonuse treatments and were less than the control. We concluded that light to moderate stocking rates are compatible to sustainable grazing of burned sagebrush steppe rangelands.},

Here, we present a novel analysis of the biotic resistance hypothesis using 24~456 observations of plant richness spanning four community types and seven ecoregions of the United States. Non-native plant occurrence was negatively related to native plant richness across all community types and ecoregions, although the strength of biotic resistance varied across different ecological, anthropogenic and climatic contexts. Our results strongly support the biotic resistance hypothesis, thus reconciling differences between experimental and observational studies and providing evidence for the shared benefits between invasive species management and native biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Species establishment within a community depends on their interactions with the local environment and resident community. Such environmental and biotic filtering is frequently inferred from functional trait and phylogenetic patterns within communities; these patterns may also predict which additional species can establish. However, differentiating between environmental and biotic filtering can be challenging, which may complicate establishment predictions. Creating a habitat-specific species pool by identifying which absent species within the region can establish in the focal habitat allows us to isolate biotic filtering by modeling dissimilarity between the observed and biotically excluded species able to pass environmental filters. Similarly, modeling the dissimilarity between the habitat-specific species pool and the environmentally excluded species within the region can isolate local environmental filters. Combined, these models identify potentially successful phenotypes and why certain phenotypes were unsuccessful. Here, we present a framework that uses the functional dissimilarity among these groups in logistic models to predict establishment of additional species. This approach can use multivariate trait distances and phylogenetic information, but is most powerful when using individual traits and their interactions. It also requires an appropriate distance-based dissimilarity measure, yet the two most commonly used indices, nearest neighbor (one species) and mean pairwise (all species) distances, may inaccurately predict establishment. By iteratively increasing the number of species used to measure dissimilarity, a functional neighborhood can be chosen that maximizes the detection of underlying trait patterns. We tested this framework using two seed addition experiments in calcareous grasslands. Although the functional neighborhood size that best fits the community's trait structure depended on the type of filtering considered, selecting these functional neighborhood sizes allowed our framework to predict up to 50\% of the variation in actual establishment from seed. These results indicate that the proposed framework may be a powerful tool for studying and predicting species establishment.},

Leaf strategies aboveground span an economic spectrum from ``live fast and die young'' to ``slow and steady,'' but the economy defined by root strategies belowground remains unclear. Here, we take a holistic view of the belowground economy and show that root-mycorrhizal collaboration can short circuit a one-dimensional economic spectrum, providing an entire space of economic possibilities. Root trait data from 1810 species across the globe confirm a classical fast-slow ``conservation'' gradient but show that most variation is explained by an orthogonal ``collaboration'' gradient, ranging from ``do-it-yourself'' resource uptake to ``outsourcing'' of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi. This broadened ``root economics space'' provides a solid foundation for predictive understanding of belowground responses to changing environmental conditions. Collaboration broadens the ``root economics space'' ranging from ``do-it-yourself'' to ``outsourcing'' to mycorrhizal partners.

  abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

Community stability can be achieved by higher species diversity (portfolio effect), higher asynchrony across species (insurance hypothesis) and higher abundance of populations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways and whether they interact with land use in real-world ecosystems is unknown. We monitored inter-annual fluctuations of 2,671 plant, arthropod, bird and bat species in 300 sites from three regions. Arthropods show 2.0-fold and birds 3.7-fold higher community fluctuations in grasslands than in forests, suggesting a negative impact of forest conversion. Land-use intensity in forests has a negative net impact on stability of bats and in grasslands on birds. Our findings demonstrate that asynchrony across species--much more than species diversity alone--is the main driver of variation in stability across sites and requires more attention in sustainable management.},

  abstract = {Land-use intensification drives changes in microbial communities and the soil functions they regulate, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood as land use can affect soil communities both directly (e.g. via changes in soil fertility) and indirectly (e.g. via changes in plant inputs). The speed of microbial responses is also poorly understood. For instance, whether it is long-term legacies or short-term changes in land-use intensity that drive changes in microbial communities. To address these topics, we measured multiple microbial functions, bacterial and fungal biomass and abiotic soil properties at two time intervals 3 years apart. This was performed in 150 grassland sites differing greatly in management intensity across three German regions. Observed changes in microbial soil properties were related to both long-term means and short-term changes in: abiotic soil properties, land-use intensity, community abundance-weighted means of plant functional traits and plant biomass properties in regression and structural equation models. Plant traits, particularly leaf phosphorus, and soil pH were the best predictors of change in soil microbial function, as well as fungal and bacterial biomass, while land-use intensity showed weaker effects. Indirect legacy effects, in which microbial change was explained by the effects of long-term land-use intensity on plant traits, were important, thus indicating a time lag between plant community and microbial change. Whenever the effects of short-term changes in land-use intensity were present, they acted directly on soil microorganisms. Synthesis. The results provide new evidence that soil communities and their functioning respond to short-term changes in land-use intensity, but that both rapid and longer time-scale responses to changes in plant functional traits are at least of equal importance. This suggests that management which shapes plant communities may be an effective means of managing soil communities and the functions and services they provide.},

Despite a rapidly expanding quantitative literature, it remains challenging to conceptualize concurrent changes in multiple trait dimensions (``trait space'') and select quantitative functional diversity methods to test hypotheses prior to analysis. To address this need, we present a widely applicable framework for visualizing ecological phenomena in trait space to guide the selection, application, and interpretation of quantitative functional diversity methods. We describe five hypotheses that represent general patterns of responses to disturbance in functional community ecology and then apply a formal decision process to determine appropriate quantitative methods to test ecological hypotheses. As a part of this process, we devise a new statistical approach to test for functional turnover among communities. Our combination of hypotheses and metrics can be applied broadly to address ecological questions across a range of systems and study designs. We illustrate the framework with a case study of disturbance in freshwater communities. This hypothesis-driven approach will increase the rigor and transparency of applied functional trait studies.},

In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.},

Theory predicts that food-limited herbivores will consume any additional biomass stimulated by nutrient inputs (`consumer-controlled'). Alternatively, nutrient supply is predicted to increase biomass where herbivores alter community composition or are limited by factors other than food (`resource-controlled'). Using an experiment replicated in 58 grasslands spanning six continents, we show that nutrient addition and vertebrate herbivore exclusion each caused sustained increases in aboveground live biomass over a decade, but consumer control was weak. However, at sites with high vertebrate grazing intensity or domestic livestock, herbivores consumed the additional fertilization-induced biomass, supporting the consumer-controlled prediction. Herbivores most effectively reduced the additional live biomass at sites with low precipitation or high ambient soil nitrogen. Overall, these experimental results suggest that grassland biomass will outstrip wild herbivore control as human activities increase elemental nutrient supply, with widespread consequences for grazing and fire risk.},

  abstract = {A grass-fire cycle in Australian tropical savannas has been postulated as driving the regional decline of the obligate-seeding conifer Callitris intratropica and other fire-sensitive components of the regional flora and fauna, due to proliferation of flammable native grasses. We tested the hypothesis that a high-biomass invasive savanna grass drives a positive feedback process where intense fires destroy fire-sensitive trees, and the reduction in canopy cover facilitates further invasion by grass. We undertook an observational and experimental study using, as a model system, a plantation of C. intratropica that has been invaded by an African grass, gamba (Andropogon gayanus) in the Northern Territory, Australia. We found that high grass biomass was associated with reduced canopy cover and restriction of foliage to the upper canopy of surviving stems, and mortality of adult trees was very high ({$>$}50\%) even in areas with low fuel loads (1 t.ha(-1)). Experimental fires, with fuel loads {$>$}10 t.ha(-1), typical of the grass-invasion front, caused significant mortality due to complete crown scorch. Lower fuel loads cause reduced canopy cover through defoliation of the lower canopy. These results help explain how increases in grass biomass are coupled with the decline of C. intratropica throughout northern Australia by causing a switch from litter and sparse perennial grass fuels, and hence low-intensity surface fires, to heavy annual grass fuel loads that sustain fires that burn into the midstorey. This study demonstrates that changes in fuel type can alter fire regimes with substantial knock-on effects on the biota.},

Thus we argue that rather than merely describing spatio-temporal patterns of fire regimes, pyrodiversity must be understood in terms of feedbacks between fire regimes, biodiversity and ecological processes. Humans shape pyrodiversity both directly, by manipulating the intensity, severity, frequency and extent of fires, and indirectly, by influencing the abundance and distribution of various trophic guilds through hunting and husbandry of animals, and introduction and cultivation of plant species. Conceptualizing landscape fire as deeply embedded in food webs suggests that the restoration of degraded ecosystems requires the simultaneous careful management of fire regimes and native and invasive plants and animals, and may include introducing new vertebrates to compensate for extinctions that occurred in the recent and more distant past.This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.},

  abstract = {This book provides an unprecedented synthesis of the current status of scientific and management knowledge regarding global rangelands and the major challenges that confront them. It has been organized around three major themes. The first summarizes the conceptual advances that have occurred in the rangeland profession. The second addresses the implications of these conceptual advances to management and policy. The third assesses several major challenges confronting global rangelands in the 21st century. This book will compliment applied range management textbooks by describing the conceptual foundation on which the rangeland profession is based. It has been written to be accessible to a broad audience, including ecosystem managers, educators, students and policy makers. The content is founded on the collective experience, knowledge and commitment of 80 authors who have worked in rangelands throughout the world. Their collective contributions indicate that a more comprehensive framework is necessary to address the complex challenges confronting global rangelands.  Rangelands represent adaptive social-ecological systems, in which societal values, organizations and capacities are of equal importance to, and interact with, those of ecological processes.  A more comprehensive framework for rangeland systems may enable management agencies, and educational, research and policy making organizations to more effectively assess complex problems and develop appropriate solutions},

  abstract = {Understanding the biodiversity and ecosystem function relationship can be challenging in species-rich ecosystems. Traditionally, species richness has been relied on heavily to explain changes in ecosystem function across diversity gradients. Diversity-Interactions models can test how ecosystem function is affected by species identity, species interactions, and evenness, in addition to richness. However, in a species-rich system, there may be too many species interactions to allow estimation of each coefficient, and if all interaction coefficients are estimable, they may be devoid of any sensible biological meaning. Parsimonious descriptions using constraints among interaction coefficients have been developed but important variability may still remain unexplained. Here, we extend Diversity-Interactions models to describe the effects of diversity on ecosystem function using a combination of fixed coefficients and random effects. Our approach provides improved standard errors for testing fixed coefficients and incorporates lack-of-fit tests for diversity effects. We illustrate our methods using data from a grassland and a microbial experiment. Our framework considerably reduces the complexities associated with understanding how species interactions contribute to ecosystem function in species-rich ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Conservation efforts typically focus on maximizing biodiversity in protected areas. The space available for reserves is limited, however, and conservation efforts must increasingly consider how management of protected areas can promote biodiversity beyond reserve borders. Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity "spillover" effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30\% of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10-18\% more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape--higher edge-to-interior ratio--created by corridors. Corridors promoted biodiversity spillover for native species of the threatened longleaf pine ecosystem being restored in our experiment, but not for exotic species. By extending economically driven spillover concepts from marine fisheries and crop pollination systems, we show how reconnecting landscapes amplifies biodiversity conservation both within and beyond reserve borders.},

Here, we explore the potential of repeated habitat mapping data to identify floristic changes over time. Using one German federal state as a case study, we assessed floristic changes between the 1980s and 2010s. These habitat data have great potential for analysis because of their high spatial coverage while also posing methodological challenges such as incomplete observation data. We developed a modelling approach that accounts for incomplete observations and explored the ability to detect temporal trends. Location The Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) Methods We compiled plant species lists from the earliest (1980s) and most recent (2010s) habitat mapping survey and aligned differing habitat definitions across mapping campaigns. A total of 5,503 mapped polygons, each with a list of species records, intersected the two surveys. We accounted for underrecorded species by assigning occurrence probabilities, based on species co-occurrence information across all surveys, using Beals' index and tested the robustness of this approach by simulation experiments. For those species with significant increases and decreases in occurrence probability, we linked these trends to the species' functional characteristics. Results We found a systematic loss of species that are moderately threatened. Species that indicate low nitrogen supply and high soil moisture declined, suggesting a shift towards a more eutrophic and drier landscape. Importantly, assessing specific plant traits associated with losses, we also detected a decrease in species with reddish and blueish flowers and species providing nectar, pointing to a decrease of insect-pollinated taxa. Main conclusions The identified changes raise concerns that plant biodiversity has fundamentally changed over the last three decades, with concomitant consequences for ecosystem services, especially pollination. Given the general lack of historical standardized data, our approach for trend analyses using incomplete observation data may be widely applicable to assess long-term biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {One of the key questions in ecosystem restoration is the choice of the seed material for restoring plant communities. The most common strategy is to use local seed sources, based on the argument that many plants are locally adapted and thus local seed sources should provide the best restoration success. However, the evidence for local adaptation is inconsistent, and some of these inconsistencies may be due to different experimental approaches that have been used to test for local adaptation. We illustrate how conclusions about local adaptation depend on the experimental design and in particular on the method of data analysis. We used data from a multispecies reciprocal transplant experiment and analyzed them in three different ways: (1) comparing local vs. foreign plants within species and sites, corresponding to tests of the "local is best" paradigm in ecological restoration, (2) comparing sympatric vs. allopatric populations across sites but within species, and (3) comparing sympatric and allopatric populations across multiple species. These approaches reflect different experimental designs: While a local vs. foreign comparison can be done even in small experiments with a single species and site, the other two approaches require a reciprocal transplant experiment with one or multiple species, respectively. The three different analyses led to contrasting results. While the local/foreign approach indicated lack of local adaptation or even maladaptation, the more general sympatric/allopatric approach rather suggested local adaptation, and the most general cross-species sympatric/allopatric test provided significant evidence for local adaptation. The analyses demonstrate how the design of experiments and methods of data analysis impact conclusions on the presence or absence of local adaptation. While small-scale, single-species experiments may be useful for identifying the appropriate seed material for a specific restoration project, general patterns can only be detected in reciprocal transplant experiments with multiple species and sites.},

Furthermore, recovery of biodiversity and services can be slow and incomplete. Despite this uncertainty, new methods of ecosystem service valuation are suggesting that the economic benefits of restoration can outweigh costs. Payment for Ecosystem Service schemes could therefore provide incentives for restoration, but require development to ensure biodiversity and multiple services are enhanced and the needs of different stakeholders are met. Such approaches must be implemented widely if new global restoration targets are to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Extensive research shows that more species-rich assemblages are generally more productive and efficient in resource use than comparable assemblages with fewer species. But the question of how diversity simultaneously affects the wide variety of ecological functions that ecosystems perform remains relatively understudied. It presents several analytical and empirical challenges that remain unresolved. In particular, researchers have developed several disparate metrics to quantify multifunctionality, each characterizing different aspects of the concept and each with pros and cons. We compare four approaches to characterizing multifunctionality and its dependence on biodiversity, quantifying (i) magnitudes of multiple individual functions separately, (ii) the extent to which different species promote different functions, (iii) the average level of a suite of functions and (iv) the number of functions that simultaneously exceeds a critical threshold. We illustrate each approach using data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment and the R multifunc package developed for this purpose, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and implement several methodological improvements. We conclude that an extension of the fourth approach that systematically explores all possible threshold values provides the most comprehensive description of multifunctionality to date. We outline this method and recommend its use in future research.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that species coexisting locally may either be functionally more dissimilar than expected by chance due to niche differentiation (`trait divergence'), or rather be functionally similar given that species bearing traits associated with low competitive ability are likely to be excluded (`trait convergence'). How the importance of trait divergence and convergence varies with productivity and depending on different plant traits still remains controversial. However assessing the effect of site productivity on meadow species assembly can help defining proper management practice for these ecosystems. We sought evidences for trait convergence and divergence across a productivity gradient over 21 wet meadows in \textasciicaron Zelezn\'e hory Mts. (Czech Republic), considering 13 plant traits. In each meadow, we recorded species composition in four 1 m2 plots divided into 100 subplots, and different environmental parameters and site characteristics linked to productivity (standing biomass, soil water table and soil nutrients content). Species spatial aggregation within plots (calculated by the V-score metric on the 100 subplots per plot averaged across all plots in each meadow) was correlated with trait dissimilarity between species in a rather limited number of cases. Significant divergence was observed when traits were considered in combination or when using phylogeny as a proxy of functional similarity. Moreover, plot level patterns of trait divergence and convergence depended on local environmental characteristics. Specifically, for several of the traits studied (e.g. lifespan, combined traits) there was evidence that functional divergence of species decreased with increasing productivity. Overall from these results at fine scale we cannot rule out neutrality, but, where significant, patterns suggest stronger effects of niche differentiation between coexisting species (trait divergence) rather than convergence of functionally similar species. Nevertheless our results also support the view that increased productivity, coupled with intense competition for resources (mainly for light), can lead to the coexistence of more functionally similar species. This is relevant because biodiversity enhancement is generally achieved by maintaining low productivity in these meadows. In general our study gives insights on how species coexistence is related to life history traits and environmental variation, which is also relevant for the conservation and management of species-rich meadows.},

We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79\% of all experiments. However, in only 12\% of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

Research in this area has often been justified on grounds that (1) loss of biological diversity ranks among the most pronounced changes to the global environment and that (2) reductions in diversity, and corresponding changes in species composition, could alter important services that ecosystems provide to humanity (e.g., food production, pest/disease control, water purification). Here we review over two decades of experiments that have examined how species richness of primary producers influences the suite of ecological processes that are controlled by plants and algae in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. Using formal meta-analyses, we assess the balance of evidence for eight fundamental questions and corresponding hypotheses about the functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems. These include questions about how primary producer diversity influences the efficiency of resource use and biomass production in ecosystems, how primary producer diversity influences the transfer and recycling of biomass to other trophic groups in a food web, and the number of species and spatial /temporal scales at which diversity effects are most apparent. After summarizing the balance of evidence and stating our own confidence in the conclusions, we outline several new questions that must now be addressed if this field is going to evolve into a predictive science that can help conserve and manage ecological processes in ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Ecologists use approaches based on plant functional traits to tackle several fundamental and applied questions. Although a perfect characterization of functional trait structure requires the measurement of all the individuals in communities, this is prohibitively resource-consuming. Consequently, the general practice is to average the trait values of a reduced number of individuals per species. However, there are different alternatives regarding the number, identity and spatial location of the individuals chosen to calculate species-averaged trait values. In this study, we compared different strategies for sampling functional traits, using community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and the Rao index of functional diversity (FD). We intensively sampled the functional trait structure along a topographical gradient in a Mediterranean grassland, obtaining accurate estimations of the `real' values of these indices (CWMI and FDI) for three traits (height, leaf area and specific leaf area). We simulated three different sampling strategies differing in the spatial location of the individuals used to estimate species-mean trait: (i) average of the whole gradient (GLO), (ii) average of the sampling unit in which the abundances of species maximize (MAX) and (iii) average of a reduced number of individuals per species and sampling unit (LOC). For each strategy, we simulated different sampling intensities (number of individuals sampled). For each trait, we examined the ability of each strategy and sampling intensity to accurately estimate CWMI and FDI, as well as their ability to detect changes in functional trait structure along the topographical gradient. LOC outperformed the other strategies in terms of accuracy and bias, and was much more efficient to describe changes along the gradient, regardless of the traits and indicators considered. Furthermore, LOC was the only strategy that improved consistently as sampling intensity increased, especially at low levels of intensity. Our results indicate that the impact of considering intraspecific variability in trait values can be greater than commonly assumed. Strategies that neglect this source of variability can result in inaccurate or biased estimations of the functional trait structure of plant communities. Most importantly, we show that intraspecific variability can be taken into consideration without any increases in the total number of individuals measured.},

There are several methods estimating the different components of FD. However, most of these methods can only be computed at limited spatial scales and cannot account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV), despite its significant contribution to FD. Trait probability density (TPD) functions (which explicitly account for ITV) reflect the probabilistic nature of niches. By doing so, the TPD approach reconciles existing methods for estimating FD within a unifying framework, allowing FD to be partitioned seamlessly across multiple scales (from individuals to species, and from local to global scales), and accounting for ITV. We present methods to estimate TPD functions at different spatial scales and probabilistic implementations of several FD concepts, including the primary components of FD (functional richness, evenness, and divergence), functional redundancy, functional rarity, and solutions to decompose beta FD into nested and unique components. The TPD framework has the potential to unify and expand analyses of functional ecology across scales, capturing the probabilistic and multidimensional nature of FD. The R package TPD (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TPD) will allow users to achieve more comparative results across regions and case studies.},

  abstract = {Restorations commonly utilize seed addition to formerly arable lands where the development of native plant communities is severely dispersal limited. However, variation in seed addition practices may profoundly affect restoration outcomes. Theory and observations predict that species-rich seed mixtures and seeding at high densities should enhance native plant community establishment, minimize exotic species cover, and may promote resistance and resilience to, and recovery from, environmental perturbations. We studied the post-seeding establishment of native plant communities in large grassland restoration plots, which were sown at two densities crossed with two levels of species richness on formerly arable land in Nebraska, USA, and their responses to drought. To evaluate drought resistance, recovery, and resilience of restored plant communities, we erected rainfall manipulation structures and tracked the response of seeded species cover and total plant biomass during experimental drought relative to controls and in the post-drought growing season. High seed richness and high-density seeding treatments resulted in greater richness and cover of native, seeded species per 0.5 m2 compared to low-richness and low-density treatments. Cover differences in response to seed mixture richness were driven by native forbs. Richness and cover of exotic species were lowest in high-richness and high-density treatments. We found little evidence of differential drought resistance, recovery, and resilience among seeding treatments. Increases in exotic species across years were restricted to drought subplots, and were not affected by seeding treatments. Grassland restoration was generally enhanced and exotic cover reduced both by the use of high-richness seed mixtures and high-density seeding. Given the lack of restoration treatment effects on the resistance, recovery, or resilience of seeded species exposed to drought, and the increases in exotic species following drought, other forms of active management may be needed to produce restored plant communities that are robust to climate change.},

Contingent biodiversity responses may depend on how disturbance and dispersal interact to alter variation in community composition ({$\beta$}-diversity) and assembly mechanisms. However, quantitative syntheses of these patterns and processes across studies are lacking. Using null-models and meta-analyses of 22 factorial experiments in herbaceous plant communities across Europe and North America, we show that disturbance diversifies communities when dispersal is limited, but homogenises communities when combined with increased immigration from the species pool. In contrast to the hypothesis that disturbance and dispersal mediate the strength of niche assembly, both processes altered {$\beta$}-diversity through neutral-sampling effects on numbers of individuals and species in communities. Our synthesis suggests that stochastic effects of disturbance and dispersal on community assembly play an important, but underappreciated, role in mediating biotic homogenisation and biodiversity responses to environmental change.},

Specifically, larger species pools increased the slope of the SAR, but not the intercept, suggesting that dispersal from a larger pool causes species to be more spatially aggregated. This increased aggregation appears to be caused by sampling effects due to fewer individuals arriving per species, rather than stronger species sorting across variation in soil moisture. These scale-dependent effects suggest that studies evaluating species pools at a single, small scale may underestimate their effects, thereby contributing to uncertainty about the importance of regional processes for community assembly and their consequences for ecological restoration.},

Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity \textendash{} species richness \textendash{} was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes\textemdash environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift\textemdash and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.},

The result demonstrates a strong and consistent pattern that species with dormant seeds have reduced spatial dispersal, also in the context of life-history traits such as seed mass and plant lifespan. Long-lived species are more likely to have large, non-dormant seeds that are dispersed far. Our findings provide robust support for the theoretical prediction of a dispersal trade-off between space and time, implying that a joint consideration of risk-spreading strategies is imperative in studying plant life-history evolution. The bet-hedging patterns in the dispersal-dormancy correlation and the associated reproductive traits have implications for biodiversity conservation, via prediction of which plant groups would be most impacted in the changing era.},

We used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to identify rhizosphere fungal communities across a natural plant richness gradient at two sites with different fertility conditions, and related the subsequent information to plant richness and productivity to elucidate the role of fungal guilds in integrating the linkages of both plant components. Saprotrophs, mycorrhizal fungi and potential plant pathogens interacted differently between the sites, with saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungal abundances being positively correlated at the high-nutrient site and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and potential plant pathogens being negatively correlated at the low-nutrient site. The synergistic associations between these fungal guilds with plant richness and productivity operated in concert to promote positive richness\textendash productivity relationships. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of soil fungal guilds in integrating the linkages of plant richness and productivity, and suggest that future work incorporating soil fungal communities into richness\textendash productivity relationships would advance our mechanistic understanding of their linkages.},

In east Kazakhstan, four steppe vegetation communities were identified based on their species composition. The first ordination axis produced by DCA of species composition was associated with a decreasing Kira's warmth index (r = 0.84, P {$<$} 0.01) and an increasing K\"oppen P/E ratio (r = 0.70, P {$<$} 0.01). The second axis was associated with succession trends within the community as a result of different human activities. We identified a strong correlation with climatic factors, indicating that temperature and precipitation may influence the species composition of the east Kazakhstan steppe irrespective of human activities. Species composition, however, is affected by human disturbance, especially in such a severe environment where mean annual precipitation is below 300 mm in Pavlodar Province.},

  abstract = {This study aims to analyze dryland dynamics under livestock production in an integrated manner, by considering several taxa, intrinsic variability in resource availability and variations in disturbance intensity and management. Resilience was assessed by quantifying functional redundancy and response diversity of vegetation, ants and small mammals in arid rangelands under continuous and rotational management strategies. The net effect of increasing grazing intensity on community resilience and the occurrence of structural (richness, diversity and composition) and functional (decomposition rate) threshold responses under the effects of seasonality and management were assessed. Results showed that grazing intensity negatively affected functional redundancy more than response diversity of all taxa and under both management strategies. Animal assemblages showed abrupt changes in richness and diversity, but vegetation showed a gradual change in structure along the grazing intensity gradient. Decomposition rate showed abrupt changes under both management strategies. Although overall community resilience decreased, not all assemblages presented a threshold response, probably due to different components of resilience affecting assemblages in different ways. These decreases caused structural threshold response within animal taxa but not on vegetation. The lack of thresholds in vegetation does not imply that a related ecosystem process is not affected (i.e., decomposition). Vegetation and animal assemblages, as well as functional and structural threshold responses, may not be strongly coupled in natural systems.},

One posits that the ability to establish at a site is determined by the availability of suitable microsites (establishment limitation), while the second asserts that recruitment is limited by the availability of seeds (seed limitation). An underlying problem is that establishment and seed limitation are typically viewed as mutually exclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of seed addition experiments to assess the relative strength of establishment and seed limitation to seedling recruitment. We asked (1) To what degree are populations seed and establishment limited? (2) Under what conditions (e.g., habitats and life-history traits) are species more or less limited by each? (3) How can seed addition studies be better designed to enhance our understanding of plant recruitment? We found that, in keeping with previous studies, most species are seed limited. However, the effects of seed addition are typically small, and most added seeds fail to recruit to the seedling stage. As a result, establishment limitation is stronger than seed limitation. Seed limitation was greater for large-seeded species, species in disturbed microsites, and species with relatively short-lived seed banks. Most seed addition experiments cannot assess the relationship between number of seeds added and number of subsequent recruits. This shortcoming can be overcome by increasing the number and range of seed addition treatments.},

Species loss in these communities ranged from 0 to 65\% of control richness. Using hierarchical structural equation modelling, we found greater species loss in communities with a lower soil cation exchange capacity, colder regional temperature, and larger production increase following N addition, independent of initial species richness, plant productivity, and the relative abundance of most plant functional groups.

  abstract = {Resprouting as a response to disturbance is now widely recognized as a key functional trait among woody plants and as the basis for the persistence niche. However, the underlying mechanisms that define resprouting responses to disturbance are poorly conceptualized. Resprouting ability is constrained by the interaction of the disturbance regime that depletes the buds and resources needed to fund resprouting, and the environment that drives growth and resource allocation. We develop a buds-protection-resources (BPR) framework for understanding resprouting in fire-prone ecosystems, based on bud bank location, bud protection, and how buds are resourced. Using this framework we go beyond earlier emphases on basal resprouting and highlight the importance of apical, epicormic and below-ground resprouting to the persistence niche. The BPR framework provides insights into: resprouting typologies that include both fire resisters (i.e. survive fire but do not resprout) and fire resprouters; the methods by which buds escape fire effects, such as thick bark; and the predictability of community assembly of resprouting types in relation to site productivity, disturbance regime and competition. Furthermore, predicting the consequences of global change is enhanced by the BPR framework because it potentially forecasts the retention or loss of above-ground biomass.},

Under global change, understanding temporal community heterogeneity is necessary for predicting the stability of ecosystem functions and services. Indeed, spatial heterogeneity is commonly used in alternative stable state theory as a predictor of temporal heterogeneity and therefore an early indicator of regime shifts. To evaluate whether spatial heterogeneity in species composition is predictive of temporal heterogeneity in ecological communities, we analyzed 68 community datasets spanning freshwater and terrestrial systems where measures of species abundance were replicated over space and time. Of the 68 data sets 55 (81\%) had a weak to strongly positive relationship between spatial and temporal heterogeneity, while in the remaining communities the relationship was weak to strongly negative (19\%). Based on a mixed model analysis, we found a significant but weak overall positive relationship between spatial and temporal heterogeneity across all data sets combined, and within aquatic and terrestrial data sets separately. In addition, lifespan and successional stage were negatively and positively related to temporal heterogeneity, respectively. We conclude that spatial heterogeneity may be a predictor of temporal heterogeneity in ecological communities, and that this relationship may be a general property of many terrestrial and aquatic communities.

In mesic grasslands, fire frequency regulates transition from grass- to shrub-dominated system states. It is uncertain, however, if increasing fire frequency can reverse shrub expansion, or if grass-shrub dynamics exhibit hysteresis. We implemented annual burning in two infrequently burned grasslands and ceased burning in two grasslands burned annually. With annual fires, grassland composition converged on that of long-term annually burned vegetation due to rapid recovery of grass cover, although shrubs persisted. When annual burning ceased, shrub cover increased, but community composition did not converge with a long-term infrequently burned reference site because of stochastic and lagged dispersal by shrubs, reflecting hysteresis. Our results demonstrated that annual burning can slow, but not reverse, shrub encroachment. In addition, reversing fire frequencies resulted in hysteresis because vegetation trajectories from grassland to shrubland differed from those of shrubland to grassland.},

While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.},

In additive partitioning, the diversity within and among samples (alpha and beta) is expressed in the same units of species richness, thus allowing direct comparison of alpha and beta. Despite its broad applicability, there are few demonstrated linkages between additive partitioning and other approaches to analysing diversity. Here, we establish several connections between diversity partitions and patterns of habitat occupancy, rarefaction, and species-area relationships. We show that observed partitions of species richness are equivalent to sample-based rarefaction curves, and expected partitions from randomization tests are approximately equivalent to individual-based rarefaction. Additive partitions can also be applied to species-area relationships to determine the relative contributions of factors influencing the beta-diversity among habitat fragments.},

This study presents Macronutrient Extraction and Determination from Invertebrates (MEDI), a protocol for the direct, rapid and relatively low-cost determination of macronutrient content from single small macroinvertebrates. Macronutrients were extracted by a sequential process of soaking in 1:12 chloroform:methanol solution to remove lipid and then solubilising tissue in 0.1 M NaOH. Proteins, carbohydrates and lipids were determined by colorimetric assays from the same individual specimens. The limits of detection of MEDI with the equipment and conditions used were 0.067, 0.065 and 0.006 mg/ml for proteins, carbohydrates and lipids respectively. Adjusting the volume of reagents used for extraction and determination can broaden the range of concentrations that can be detected. MEDI successfully identified taxonomic differences in macronutrient content between five insect species. Macronutrient Extraction and Determination from Invertebrates can directly and rapidly determine macronutrient content in tiny (dry mass 3 mg) and much larger individual invertebrates. Using MEDI, the total macronutrient content of over 50 macroinvertebrates can be determined within around 3 days of collection at a cost of \$1.35 per sample.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that several nested environmental filters, acting at different spatial scales, shape the assemblages of local plant species. However, it is unclear whether different biodiversity components, that is, taxonomy, function and phylogenetic, respond similarly to these filters. The integration of these different components into coherent and comprehensive analytical frameworks also remains unclear. In this study, we developed an approach to test the relative effects of elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing management on the functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic structures of mountain pastures. Thirty summer farms, distributed along an elevational gradient were surveyed in the Italian Alps. Within these farms (around 100 ha), we identified all areas as one of two types of management (intensive or extensive), and we sampled three plots for each area, a total of 180 plots. Using the same mathematical framework,wequantified the functional (FD), phylogenetic (PD) and taxonomic (TD) diversity of each plot. We tested the influences of three environmental filters (elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing management), using a series of partial regression analyses within a univariate and multivariate framework, as well as specific permutation schemes that accounted for our nested design. We found in different ways. This finding confirmed that these filters operate at different scales and, despite some similarities, have different effects on various biodiversity components. Interestingly, FD was the only component that responded to all three types of predictors. Regarding functional aspects, elevation, as a broad-scale environmental gradient, showed a greater influence on dominant trait values, whereas at finer scales, grazing management had a primary effect on both dominant trait values and diversity measures. Habitat fragmentation showed a primary influence on TD, probably because the effect on dispersal limitations concerned mostly species availability. The hierarchical, multi-faceted approach adopted in this study yielded insights into the factors influencing biodiversity and community assembly processes in mountain pastures, thereby highlighting the importance of considering multiple facets of diversity in assessing the role of environmental filtering in vegetation structure.},

However, the processes that govern changes in grassland burning are poorly understood, particularly on time scales beyond satellite records. We analyzed microcharcoal, sediments, and geochemistry in a high-resolution marine sediment core off Namibia to identify the processes that have controlled biomass burning in southern African grassland ecosystems under large, multimillennial-scale climate changes. Six fire cycles occurred during the past 170,000 y in southern Africa that correspond both in timing and magnitude to the precessional forcing of north-south shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Contrary to the conventional expectation that fire increases with higher temperatures and increased drought, we found that wetter and cooler climates cause increased burning in the study region, owing to a shift in rainfall amount and seasonality (and thus vegetation flammability). We also show that charcoal morphology (i.e., the particle's length-to-width ratio) can be used to reconstruct changes in fire activity as well as biome shifts over time. Our results provide essential context for understanding current and future grassland-fire dynamics and their associated carbon emissions.},

Although tropical biome distribution has traditionally been explained by climate and soil, contrasting vegetation types often occur as mosaics with sharp boundaries under very similar environmental conditions. While evidence suggests that these biomes are alternative states, empirical broad-scale support to this hypothesis is still lacking. Using community-level field data and a novel resource-niche overlap approach, we show that, for a wide range of environmental conditions, fire feedbacks maintain savannas and forests as alternative biome states in both the Neotropics and the Afrotropics. In addition, wooded grasslands and savannas occurred as alternative grassy states in the Afrotropics, depending on the relative importance of fire and herbivory feedbacks. These results are consistent with landscape scale evidence and suggest that disturbance is a general factor driving and maintaining alternative biome states and vegetation mosaics in the tropics.},

  abstract = {Kazakhstan is the second largest country to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Consequent to the abrupt institutional changes surrounding the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Kazakhstan has reportedly undergone extensive land cover/land use change. Were the institutional changes sufficiently great to affect land surface phenology at spatial resolutions and extents relevant to mesoscale meteorological models? To explore this question, we used the NDVI time series (1985\textendash 1988 and 1995\textendash 1999) from the Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Land (PAL) dataset, which consists of 10 days maximum NDVI composites at a spatial resolution of 8 km. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were extracted from the NCEP Reanalysis Project and 10 days composites of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) were produced. We selected for intensive study seven agricultural areas ranging from regions with rain-fed spring wheat cultivation in the north to regions of irrigated cotton and rice in the south. We applied three distinct but complementary statistical analyses: (1) nonparametric testing of sample distributions; (2) simple time series analysis to evaluate trends and seasonality; and (3) simple regression models describing NDVI as a quadratic function of AGDD.   The irrigated areas displayed different temporal developments of NDVI between 1985\textendash 1988 and 1995\textendash 1999. As the temperature regime between the two periods was not significantly different, we conclude that observed differences in the temporal development of NDVI resulted from changes in agricultural practices.   In the north, the temperature regime was also comparable for both periods. Based on extant socioeconomic studies and our model analyses, we conclude that the changes in the observed land surface phenology in the northern regions are caused by large increases in fallow land dominated by weedy species and by grasslands under reduced grazing pressure. Using multiple lines of evidence allowed us to build a case of whether differences in land surface phenology were mostly the result of anthropogenic influences or interannual climatic fluctuations.

  abstract = {Effective assessment of the success of ecological restoration projects is critical in justifying the use of restoration in natural resource management as well as improving best practice. One of the main goals of ecological restoration is the recovery of ecosystem function, yet most researchers assume that increasing species and or functional diversity equates with restoration of ecosystem function, rather than empirically demonstrating these mechanistic relationships. In this study, we assess how dung beetle species diversity, community composition, functional diversity and ecological functions vary along a restoration chronosequence and compare restored areas with reference (rain forest) and degraded (pasture) systems. We also directly investigate the dung beetle diversity \textendash{} ecosystem functioning relationship in the context of ecological rain forest restoration by testing the predictive power of traditional taxonomic indices and functional diversity metrics for functionality. Species richness, abundance, biomass and functional richness all increased with restoration age, with the oldest restoration sites being most similar to rain forest, whereas functional evenness and functional divergence decreased with restoration age. Community composition in the restored areas was clearly progressing towards the rain forest sites and deviating from the pasture sites with increasing restoration age. Secondary seed dispersal rates increased with restoration age, but there was only a weak positive relationship between dung removal and soil excavation and restoration age. Biodiversity metrics explained 47\textendash 74\% of the variation in functions mediated by dung beetles; however, functional trait-based indices provided greater explanatory power of functionality than traditional species-based metrics. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide empirical evidence on the potential of tropical forest restoration to mitigate biodiversity losses, recovering not only faunal species diversity, but also functional diversity and ecosystem functions in a relatively short period of time. We also demonstrate that functional trait-based metrics are better predictors of functionality than traditional species-based metrics but that the relationship between restoration age, diversity and ecosystem functioning is not straightforward and depends on the functions, traits and metrics used.},

  abstract = {Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates is a major driver of global vegetation dynamics. However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.},

Understanding how these ecosystem services - and the ecosystem properties underpinning them - respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species' effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms - which both depend on combinations of functional traits - correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species' phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

  abstract = {In this article, we explain an often overlooked process that may significantly contribute to positive correlations between measures of species diversity and community stability. Empirical studies showing positive stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

  abstract = {Questions Seedling recruitment is a key step in any seed-based ecological restoration project. There is a controversial discussion (a) whether soil preparation is required to reduce competition of pre-existing vegetation, or whether vegetation cover facilitate seedling recruitment, and (b) whether grazing should be excluded in initial stages of grassland restoration to protect seedlings, because grazing exclusion may also favour competitive ruderal species. We set up a combined soil preparation and grazing experiment to evaluate the effect of both factors on seedling recruitment of seeds transferred from a species-rich donor site. Location Upper Durance valley, Hautes-Alpes, France. Methods The experiment was set up using a full factorial split-plot design with five replicate sites. The treatments included soil preparation (harrowed or not) and grazing (excluded or not). Seeds were transferred using plant material brushed in a non-degraded reference grassland. The individuals of all occurring species were counted on the restoration sites, and the survival and reproduction of two focal species, Bromopsis erecta and Rhinanthus alectorolophus, were recorded for three months. Results Soil preparation by harrowing reduced the density of spontaneously emerging species and increased the seedling density of species transferred from the donor site. Grazing had only a weak negative effect on the recruitment of transferred species. The main effect of both treatments on seedling survival was not significant, but a significant interaction indicated that the grazing effect depended on soil preparation, with a negative effect of grazing only in non-harrowed plots. Conclusions The reduction of competition by soil preparation before seed addition of brush material had a positive effect on the seedling recruitment of transferred species and can thus clearly be recommended in our study system. The weak negative effect of grazing may not always justify fencing costs.},

  abstract = {Plant functional traits are now frequently used instead of species identity to identify how plant species co-exist in assemblages. One notion is that species inhabiting the same environment have more characteristics in common than species from different habitats, leading to different prevailing dominant traits along environmental gradients, and also to a lesser diversity of traits in habitats that impose a stronger filter on these traits. Though such patterns have been demonstrated for different environmental drivers and different traits, studies using easily available traits connected to above ground processes (i.e. traits of the leaf-height-seed, or LHS, strategy scheme) are largely overrepresented in these analyses. Here we combined data on clonal and bud bank traits, representing the ability to reproduce and spread vegetatively, with LHS trait data and examined how these traits varied in relation to the vegetational composition of 29 Central-European habitat types. Our analysis focused on determining whether clonal/bud bank or LHS traits play an important role for environmental filtering along gradients approximated by Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) across these habitats. Our results show that clonal and bud bank traits are at least as \textendash{} if not more \textendash{} important for the differentiation of the 29 habitat types. Overall, diversity and dominance of clonal and bud bank traits was more strongly correlated with gradients of light availability, temperature, moisture, soil reaction, and nutrient availability across these habitats than it was the case for traits of the leaf-height-seed scheme. Our results call for a stronger integration of belowground traits into the functional traits approach in plant ecology and for an extension of efforts to collect such data.},

The sustainability and the multiple benefits derived from these complex social-ecological systems is increasingly threatened by weed invasion, extreme disturbance, urban development, and the impacts of a rapidly changing and increasingly variable climate. California's grasslands, oak savannas, and oak woodlands are among the most invaded ecosystems in the world. Weed eradication efforts are rarely combined with seeding on these landscapes despite support for the inclusion of the practice in a weed management program. Depending on seed mix choice, cost and long-term uncertainty, especially for native seed, is an impediment to adoption by land managers. We investigated four seeding mixes (forage annual, native perennial, exotic perennial, and exotic-native perennial) to evaluate how these treatments resist reinvasion and support the delivery of simultaneous multiple ecosystem services (invasion resistance, native richness, nitrogen fixing plants, pollinator food sources, plant community diversity, forage quality, and productivity). We found the increase of exotic and native perennial cover will drive resistance to an invading weedy summer flowering forb Centaurea solstitialis but provides a mixed response to resisting invasive annual grasses. The resistance to invasion is coupled with little tradeoff in forage productivity and quality and gains in plant diversity and native cover.},

Whilst measures to enhance the diversity of agriculturally-improved grasslands are in place, success has often been limited. One of the primary factors limiting success is the paucity of sources of propagules of desirable species in the surrounding landscape. The restoration of two contrasting grassland types (lowland hay meadow and chalk grassland) was examined using a replicated block experiment to assess the effectiveness of two methods of seed application (hay strewing and brush harvesting) and two methods of pre-treatment disturbance (power harrowing and turf stripping). The resulting changes in botanical composition were monitored for 4 years. Seed addition by both methods resulted in significant temporal trends in plant species composition and increases in plant species richness, which were further enhanced by disturbance. Power harrowing increased the effectiveness of the seed addition treatments at the lowland hay meadow site. At the chalk grassland site a more severe disturbance created by turf stripping was used and shown to be preferable. Whilst both hay strewing and brush harvesting increased plant species richness, hay strewing was more effective at creating a sward similar to that of the donor site. Soil disturbance and seed application rate at the recipient site and timing of the hay cut at the donor site are all factors to be considered prior to the commencement of restoration management.},

In contrast, neophytes (species introduced after 1492) increased in their nationwide occurrence but not homogeneously throughout the country. Our analysis suggests that the strongest declines in native species already happened in the 1960s\textendash 1980s, a time frame in which often few data exist. Increases in neophytic species were strongest in the 1990s and 2010s. Overall, the increase in neophytes did not compensate for the loss of other species, resulting in a decrease in mean grid cell species richness of -1.9\% per decade. The decline in plant biodiversity is a widespread phenomenon occurring in different habitats and geographic regions. It is likely that this decline has major repercussions on ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity, potentially with cascading effects across trophic levels. The approach used in this study is transferable to other large-scale trend analyses using heterogeneous occurrence data.},

Arid and semiarid environments are susceptible to environmental degradation and desertification. Modelling net primary productivity (NPP) and analysis of spatio-temporal patterns help to understand ecological functioning especially in these areas. In this study, we apply the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology Model (BETHY/DLR) to derive NPP for Kazakhstan for 2003\textendash 2011. Results are analyzed regarding spatial, monthly, and inter-annual variations. Mean annual NPP for Kazakhstan is 143~g~C~m-2 and maximum productivity is reached in June. Most monthly NPP anomalies occur in semiarid North of Kazakhstan. These regions seem to be most strongly affected by changes in meteorology and are likely to be vulnerable to changing climate. Arid ecosystems show lower inter-annual NPP variability than semiarid lands. Correlations between NPP and meteorological parameters reveal variable influence of temperature, PAR, and precipitation on vegetation productivity during the year. Reaction of vegetation growth to precipitation is delayed 1\textendash 2 months. Temperature is most critical in spring and precipitation in summer affects NPP in August\textendash October. The results presented in this study help to identify regions that are vulnerable to global change. They allow predictions on possible effects of expected future climate change on vegetation productivity in arid and semiarid Kazakhstan and support sustainable land management.},

  abstract = {Question: How does the plant species composition of Pontic\textendash Pannonian saltrich habitats vary on a large geographical scale? Do the floristic differences between Pannonia and the Balkans correspond to the current phytosociological classification?   Location: Pannonia (Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Romania) and the Balkans (Bulgaria,Macedonia, Greece).   Methods: Two thousand four hundred and thirty-seven releves from halophytic and sub-halophytic habitats were classified using a modified TWINSPAN. The crispness of classification was checked. DCA and CCA with climate data as explanatory variables were applied.   Results: The classification was best interpreted at the level of 15 clusters. The vegetation changed along the salinity gradient from sub-halophytic grasslands (including Trifolion resupinati alliance of the Molinio-Arrhenatheretalia class and Beckmannion eruciformis and Festucion pseudovinae p. p. alliances of the Festuco- Puccinellietea class) and reed beds (Bolboschoenion maritimi p. p. alliance; the Phragmito-Magnocaricetea class), through steppe and wet inland halophytic vegetation (Festucion pseudovinae p. p., Puccinellion limosae, Pucinellion convolutae, Bolboschoenion maritimi p. p. and Juncion gerardii of the Festuco-Puccinellietea class) towards the extreme halophytic vegetation of the Thero-Salicornietea, Crypsietea and Juncetea maritimi classes. This gradient was longer in the Balkan region, where it spanned from the sub-mediterranean salt-rich grasslands to the extremely halophytic vegetation at the Black Sea coast. The second most important gradient coincided with the water regime. Some vegetation types appeared to be confined to either the Pannonian or the Balkan region (especially within dry sub-halophytic and steppe halophytic grasslands), while others were distributed across the entire study area. The above-mentioned pattern did not always correspond with current classification systems.   Conclusions: Variation in salt-rich vegetation predominantly follows the salinity and water regime gradients. Geographical variation, generally coinciding with climatic and historical effects, is also important, especially in drier salt-rich habitats. Our large-scale analysis of the floristic variation of salt-rich habitats might be useful for the unification of classification systems that differ substantially between the countries involved. In addition, the analysis may be useful for adjustment of a classification system in the poorly explored Balkan region, where particular vegetation types were identified with, or delimited from, Central European vegetation types without detailed comparative analysis until now.},

  abstract = {Human use of land has transformed ecosystem pattern and process across most of the terrestrial biosphere, a global change often described as historically recent and potentially catastrophic for both humanity and the biosphere. Interdisciplinary paleoecological, archaeological, and historical studies challenge this view, indicating that land use has been extensive and sustained for millennia in some regions and that recent trends may represent as much a recovery as an acceleration. Here we synthesize recent scientific evidence and theory on the emergence, history, and future of land use as a process transforming the Earth System and use this to explain why relatively small human populations likely caused widespread and profound ecological changes more than 3,000 y ago, whereas the largest and wealthiest human populations in history are using less arable land per person every decade. Contrasting two spatially explicit global reconstructions of land-use history shows that reconstructions incorporating adaptive changes in land-use systems over time, including land-use intensification, offer a more spatially detailed and plausible assessment of our planet's history, with a biosphere and perhaps even climate long ago affected by humans. Although land-use processes are now shifting rapidly from historical patterns in both type and scale, integrative global land-use models that incorporate dynamic adaptations in human-environment relationships help to advance our understanding of both past and future land-use changes, including their sustainability and potential global effects.},

  abstract = {Species-rich semi-natural grasslands are highly endangered habitats in Central Europe and numerous restoration efforts have been made to compensate for the losses in the last decades. However, some plant species could become more easily established than others. The establishment success of 37 species was analyzed over 6~years at two study sites of a restoration project in Germany where hay transfer and sowing of threshing material in combination with additional sowing were applied. The effects of the restoration method applied, time since the restoration took place, traits related to germination, dispersal, and reproduction, and combinations of these traits on the establishment were analyzed. While the specific restoration method of how seeds were transferred played a subordinate role, the establishment success depended in particular on traits such as flower season or the lifeform. Species flowering in autumn, such as Pastinaca sativa and Serratula tinctoria, became established better than species flowering in other seasons, probably because they could complete their life cycle, resulting in increasingly stronger seed pressure with time. Geophytes, like Allium angulosum and Galium boreale, became established very poorly, but showed an increase with study duration. For various traits, we found significant trait by method and trait by year interactions, indicating that different traits promoted establishment under different conditions. Using a multi-model approach, we tested whether traits acted in combination. For the first years and the last year, we found that models with three traits explained establishment success better than models with a single trait or two traits. While traits had only an additive effect on the establishment success in the first years, trait interactions became important thereafter. The most important trait was the season of flowering, which occurred in all best models from the third year onwards. Overall, our approach revealed the potential of functional trait analysis to predict success in restoration projects.},

Improved understanding of how grasses--the dominant clade in these important ecosystems--will respond to alterations in fire regimes is needed in the face of anthropogenically driven climate and land-use change. Here, we examined how grass communities shift in response to experimentally manipulated fire regimes at multiple levels of community diversity--taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional--in C4-dominanted mesic savanna grassland sites with similar structure and physiognomy, yet disparate biogeographic histories. We found that the grass communities were similar in their phylogenetic response and aspects of their functional response to high fire frequency. Both sites exhibited phylogenetic clustering of highly abundant species in annually burned plots, driven by species of the Andropogoneae, and a narrow range of functional strategies associated with rapid post-fire regeneration in a high-light, nitrogen-limited environment. By examining multiple facets of diversity in a comparative context, we identified convergent phylogenetic and functional responses to altered fire regimes in two mesic savanna grasslands. Our results highlight the importance of a common filtering process associated with fire that is consistent across grasslands of disparate biogeographic histories and taxonomic representation.},

  abstract = {Globally, grasslands are shaped by grazing and fire, and grassland plants are adapted to these disturbances. However, temperate grasslands have been hotspots of land-use change, and how such changes affect interrelations between herbivory, fire and vegetation are poorly understood. Such land-use changes are widespread on the Eurasian steppe, where the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered the abandonment of cropland and pasture on globally relevant scales. Thus, to determine how relationships between plant functional composition, grazing and fire patterns changed after the Soviet Union dissolved, we studied a 358,000 km2 region in the dry steppe of Kazakhstan, combining a large field dataset on plant functional traits with multi-scale satellite data. We found that increases in burned area corresponded to decreases in livestock grazing across large areas. Furthermore, fires occurred more often with high cover of grasses with high leaf dry matter content and thus higher flammability, whereas higher grazing pressure favoured grazing-tolerant woody forbs and ruderal plants with high specific leaf area. The current situation of low grazing pressure represents a historically exceptional, potentially non-analogue state. We suggest that the dissolution of the Soviet Union caused the disturbance regime to shift from grazer to fire control. As grazing and fire each result in different plant functional compositions, we propose that this led to widespread increases in grasses and associated changes in steppe plant community structure. These changes have potentially occurred across an area of more than 2 million km2, representing much of the world's largest temperate grassland area, with globally relevant, yet poorly understood implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functions such as carbon cycling. Additionally, future steppe management must also consider positive implications of abandonment (`rewilding') because reverting the regime shift in disturbance and associated changes in vegetation would require grazing animals to be reintroduced across vast areas.},

However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we review 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of traits of root systems, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluate the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that below-ground traits with widest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the fair estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally-relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis-based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with strongest influence on the functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of fire and grazing is largely based on small-scale experimental studies in which treatments are uniformly applied to experimental units that are considered homogenous. Any discussion of an interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire). Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem function of North American and African grasslands. This study is different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring the interaction with fire and other disturbances.},

We examine how concepts pertaining to the assembly of plant communities can be used to strengthen resistance to invasion in restored communities. Community ecology theory predicts that an invasive species will be unlikely to establish if there is a species with similar traits present in the resident community or if available niches are filled. Therefore, successful restoration efforts should select native species with traits similar to likely invaders and include a diversity of functional traits. The success of trait-based approaches to restoration will depend largely on the diversity of invaders, on the strength of environmental factors and on dispersal dynamics of invasive and native species.},

Understanding and predicting ecological processes from species' traits has been considered a 'Holy Grail' in ecology. Plant functional traits are increasingly being used to develop mechanistic models that can predict how ecological communities will respond to abiotic and biotic perturbations and how species will affect ecosystem function and services in a rapidly changing world; however, significant challenges remain. In this review, we highlight recent work and outstanding questions in three areas: (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the characterization of plant strategies based on traits and trait relationships, and the integration of traits into multivariate indices and models of community and ecosystem function. However, the utility of trait-based approaches in ecology will benefit from efforts that demonstrate how these traits and indices influence organismal, community, and ecosystem processes across vegetation types, which may be achieved through meta-analysis and enhancement of trait databases. Additionally, intraspecific trait variation and species interactions need to be incorporated into predictive models using tools such as Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Finally, existing models linking traits to community and ecosystem processes need to be empirically tested for their applicability to be realized.},

  abstract = {Fire-prone invasive grasses create novel ecosystem threats by increasing fine-fuel loads and continuity, which can alter fire regimes. While the existence of an invasive grass-fire cycle is well known, evidence of altered fire regimes is typically based on local-scale studies or expert knowledge. Here, we quantify the effects of 12 nonnative, invasive grasses on fire occurrence, size, and frequency across 29 US ecoregions encompassing more than one third of the conterminous United States. These 12 grass species promote fire locally and have extensive spatial records of abundant infestations. We combined agency and satellite fire data with records of abundant grass invasion to test for differences in fire regimes between invaded and nearby "uninvaded" habitat. Additionally, we assessed whether invasive grass presence is a significant predictor of altered fire by modeling fire occurrence, size, and frequency as a function of grass invasion, in addition to anthropogenic and ecological covariates relevant to fire. Eight species showed significantly higher fire-occurrence rates, which more than tripled for Schismus barbatus and Pennisetum ciliare. Six species demonstrated significantly higher mean fire frequency, which more than doubled for Neyraudia reynaudiana and Pennisetum ciliare Grass invasion was significant in fire occurrence and frequency models, but not in fire-size models. The significant differences in fire regimes, coupled with the importance of grass invasion in modeling these differences, suggest that invasive grasses alter US fire regimes at regional scales. As concern about US wildfires grows, accounting for fire-promoting invasive grasses will be imperative for effectively managing ecosystems.},

The aim of this study was to test whether the dominance hypothesis applies to assess the impacts of environmental gradients and management regimes on this component of herbage nutritive value in permanent grasslands.   2. At the plant level, digestibility has been related to a number of functional traits, but whether this can be scaled up to the community level in species-rich grasslands and how such relationships are modulated by environmental conditions and management regimes remain unknown. Our primary objective was to test whether community-weighted means \textendash{} species trait values weighted by the species abundance \textendash{} of morphological, phenological and chemical traits could be used to explain variations in digestibility over a large range of climatic contexts, soil resource levels and management regimes. Our second objective was to explain variations in community digestibility within and among nine contrasting sites along large natural and man-induced environmental gradients.   3. Over the whole data set, digestibility and most community-weighted means of traits responded to climatic factors and management regimes, but relations were not always significant when each site was considered separately. Community digestibility was significantly related to one or more plant traits within each site and to all of the measured traits when considering all the sites. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) had the most consistent effects on digestibility, with a strikingly similar negative effect within each site. Potential evapotranspiration was negatively related to digestibility and contributed to explain a large part of the among-site variance. In addition, a low return interval of disturbance and a high disturbance intensity (biomass removal) were both associated with a high digestibility.   4. Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regime, plant traits and local climate impacted dry matter digestibility roughly equally in grasslands. The effects of community composition on digestibility and its response to abiotic factors could be successfully captured by communityweighted means of leaf dry matter content. This functional marker can be used to develop indicators and grassland management rules to support farmers in the refinement of their practices towards specific needs, such as target production outputs.},

The concept of EMF itself, the analytical approaches used to calculate it, and its implications depending on the spatial scale and field of study have been discussed in detail. However, to date there has been little dialogue concerning the basis of EMF studies: what should or should not be considered appropriate measures for ecosystem functions. To begin this discussion, we performed an in-depth review of EMF studies across four major terrestrial ecosystems (agroecosystems, drylands, forests and grasslands) by analysing 82 studies, which together have assessed 775 ecosystem functions from a variety of field and greenhouse experiments across the globe. The number of ecosystem functions analysed varied from two to 82 per study and we found large differences in the distribution of functions across ecosystem types and ecosystem service categories. Furthermore, there was little explanation of why certain variables were included in the EMF calculation or how they relate to ecosystem functioning. Synthesis. Based on the literature analysis, it is clear that there is no general agreement regarding which measurements should or should not be considered functions in the field of ecology. To address this issue, we propose a general guideline for determining and measuring appropriate functions.},

  abstract = {Research has delivered convincing findings on the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and humankind. Indeed, ecosystems provide provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about US\$ 232~ha-1~year-1. Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that influence plant diversity of permanent grasslands, and we describe underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of permanent grasslands cannot be explained simply by agricultural management rules, e.g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape, e.g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity, acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major species sources for permanent grasslands according to the seed flow. We discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant species composition of permanent grasslands and the necessity to study plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model based on three ecological challenges\textemdash dispersal, establishment, and persistence\textemdash that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity, and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape heterogeneity on plant diversity. Last, we discuss the ability of farmers to manage each factor and the necessity of such study in the improvement of the current agro-environment schemes efficiency for farmland biodiversity restoration or preservation.},

For the effectiveness of Protected areas and Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures, an indicator has been proposed for ``areas meeting their documented ecological objectives.'' However, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has not identified or agreed on what data should inform this indicator. Here we draw on experiences from the assessment of protected area effectiveness in the CBD's previous strategic plan to provide recommendations on the essential elements related to biodiversity outcomes and management that need to be captured in this updated indicator as well as how this could be done. Our proposed protected area effectiveness indicators include a combination of remotely derived products for all protected areas, combined with data from monitoring of both protected area management and trends in species and ecosystems based on field observations. Additionally, we highlight the need for creating a digital infrastructure to operationalize national-level data-capture. We believe these steps are critical and urge the adoption of suitable protected area effectiveness indicators before the post-2020 framework is agreed in 2021.},

  abstract = {Newly emerging plants provide the best forage for herbivores. To exploit this fleeting resource, migrating herbivores align their movements to surf the wave of spring green-up. With new technology to track migrating animals, the Green Wave Hypothesis has steadily gained empirical support across a diversity of migratory taxa. This hypothesis assumes the green wave is controlled by variation in climate, weather, and topography, and its progression dictates the timing, pace, and extent of migrations. However, aggregate grazers that are also capable of engineering grassland ecosystems make some of the world's most impressive migrations, and it is unclear how the green wave determines their movements. Here we show that Yellowstone's bison (Bison bison) do not choreograph their migratory movements to the wave of spring green-up. Instead, bison modify the green wave as they migrate and graze. While most bison surfed during early spring, they eventually slowed and let the green wave pass them by. However, small-scale experiments indicated that feedback from grazing sustained forage quality. Most importantly, a 6-fold decadal shift in bison density revealed that intense grazing caused grasslands to green up faster, more intensely, and for a longer duration. Our finding broadens our understanding of the ways in which animal movements underpin the foraging benefit of migration. The widely accepted Green Wave Hypothesis needs to be revised to include large aggregate grazers that not only move to find forage, but also engineer plant phenology through grazing, thereby shaping their own migratory movements.},

However it appears that simple "proof" of such a connection cannot easily be demonstrated and involves a lot of contingencies. The different meanings of "ecosystem functioning" may be crucial for attempts to show the importance of biodiversity and to assess possible redundancy. If "ecosystem functioning" means only total production organic matter or consumption of CO\textsubscript{2} then some degree of redundancy in species diversity of autotrophs will be obvious in most cases. However if "ecosystem functioning" includes the synthesis of all compounds that plants, animals and other organisms of a given community contain in their bodies or release in the environment, then any decrease in species diversity will be meaningful and any redundancy will be impossible by definition. In accordance with such a definition biodiversity obviously cannot be diminished without some loss of ecosystem functioning. I emphasize that attempts to conserve biodiversity do not need special justification in possible relationships between diversity and ecosystem services. If biodiversity has intrinsic value it means that it could in principle be "useless" for human needs or for "ecosystem functioning".},

  abstract = {Understanding how communities of living organisms assemble has been a central question in ecology since the early days of the discipline. Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co-occur randomly but are restricted in their co-occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co-occurrence of species is a product of chance, historical patterns of speciation and migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, and biotic interactions, with none of these processes being mutually exclusive. Here we present a survey and meta-analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with null models simulating random patterns of species assembly. According to the type of data under study and the different methods that are applied to detect community assembly, we distinguish four main types of approach in the published literature: species co-occurrence, niche limitation, guild proportionality and limiting similarity. Results from our meta-analyses suggest that non-random co-occurrence of plant species is not a widespread phenomenon. However, whether this finding reflects the individualistic nature of plant communities or is caused by methodological shortcomings associated with the studies considered cannot be discerned from the available metadata. We advocate that more thorough surveys be conducted using a set of standardized methods to test for the existence of assembly rules in data sets spanning larger biological and geographical scales than have been considered until now. We underpin this general advice with guidelines that should be considered in future assembly rules research. This will enable us to draw more accurate and general conclusions about the non-random aspect of assembly in plant communities.},

  abstract = {In East Africa fire and grazing by wild and domestic ungulates maintain savannas, and pastoralists historically set fires and herded livestock through the use of temporary corrals called bomas. In recent decades traditional pastoral practices have declined, and this may be affecting biodiversity. We investigated the effects of prescribed fires and bomas on savanna bird communities in East Africa during the first and second dry seasons of the year (respectively before and after the rains that mark the onset of breeding for most birds). We compared abundance, richness, and community composition on 9-ha burned plots, recently abandoned bomas, and control plots in the undisturbed matrix habitat over a 3-year period. Generally, recently burned areas and abandoned bomas attracted greater densities of birds and had different community assemblages than the surrounding matrix. The effects of disturbances were influenced by interactions between primary productivity, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index, and time. Bird densities were highest and a greater proportion of species was observed on burned plots in the months following the fires. Drought conditions equalized bird densities across treatments within 1 year, and individuals from a greater proportion of species were more commonly observed on abandoned bomas. Yearly fluctuations in abundance were less pronounced on bomas than on burns, which indicate that although fire may benefit birds in the short term, bomas may have a more-lasting positive effect and provide resources during droughts. Several Palearctic migrants were attracted to burned plots regardless of rainfall, which indicates continued fire suppression may threaten their already-declining populations. Most notably, the paucity of birds observed on the controls suggests that the current structure of the matrix developed as a result of fire suppression. Traditional pastoralism appears critical to the maintenance of avian diversity in these savannas.},

  abstract = {The outcomes of ecological restoration are notoriously unpredictable, but we have no general predictive understanding of this contingency. Management decisions can have strong effects on restoration outcomes, but in other cases may be overwhelmed by site characteristics (e.g. soil conditions), landscape context (e.g. abundance of similar habitat) or historical factors (e.g. priority effects). However, we generally cannot predict which of these four classes of drivers will affect restoration outcomes. Disparate aspects of restoration outcomes (e.g. species richness, beta diversity and community composition) and their unique responses further complicate our understanding. Finally, these four classes of drivers might differentially affect subsets of the restored community, where, for example, management might shape the abundance and distribution of species of the target community, while other species are more contingent on site, landscape or historical factors. Here, we used variation partitioning to compare the relative importance of management, site, landscape and historical factors for determining the plant community outcomes of 27 prairie restorations in south-west Michigan. We found that management, especially the composition, diversity and density of seed mixes applied, and history, especially site age, were the most important drivers of prairie restoration species richness, beta diversity and composition. Site and landscape factors were only rarely important for restoration outcomes. Finally, we found that comparing the unique responses of sown and non-sown species typically increased our understanding of the dynamics contributing to community-wide restoration outcomes. Synthesis and applications. This is, to our knowledge, the first quantitative comparison of how four major classes of drivers determine the outcome of restoration. Historical legacies and management decisions, but generally not landscape context or local site conditions, shaped plant communities at restored sites. These findings represent an important step towards developing a more predictive framework for understanding contingency in restoration outcomes.},

However, the concept has remained largely theoretical, with a paucity of empirical tests. As such, the applicability of assembly filters theory to ecological restoration remains incompletely known. We tested the relative strengths of dispersal and establishment filters by comparing the plant species composition, measured by species' presence/absence, in 29 restored prairies with the seed mixes used to restore each prairie. We found that both establishment and dispersal filters limited prairie similarity to the seed mix. Sown species responded differentially to filters, with a few species limited only by dispersal (seed density), many others limited only by establishment conditions (i.e. organic matter and sand content of soils, land use history, and fire frequency), and others limited by both dispersal and establishment filters. A few species, typically those sown most often, were not restricted by dispersal or establishment filters, likely because they were sown in high enough densities and all sites had suitable environmental conditions. Finally, one group of species established poorly, but we could not attribute this to either dispersal or establishment filters. This information can help land managers select species likely to establish in restorations when sown at sufficient densities. These results illustrate that dispersal and establishment filters limit the establishment of species in restored communities and these filters are species-dependent. Identifying the most limiting filter(s) for species will inform strategies to increase their establishment success.},

  abstract = {The loss of biodiversity at local and larger scales has potentially dramatic effects on ecosystem functioning. Many studies have shown that ecosystem functioning depends on biodiversity, but the role of beta diversity, spatial variation in community composition, is less clear than that of local-scale (alpha) diversity. To test the hypothesis that beta diversity would increase ecosystem multifunctionality through variation in species functional traits, we gathered data on plant community composition, plant functional traits, and seven ecosystem functions across 29 restored prairies. We found that averaged multifunctionality (mean of seven ecosystem functions) increased with both taxonomic beta diversity and functional beta diversity. The abundance of the dominant species, big bluestem, played a more minor role, suggesting a limited role for the selection effect. Neither taxonomic nor functional alpha richness was associated with multifunctionality, though this finding may be sensitive to the identity of the functions included because alpha diversity was associated with some individual functions in opposing directions. These findings suggest that in systems structured largely by natural processes, beta diversity (a patchwork of functionally different plant communities) and dominant species abundance may be more important than alpha diversity in fostering ecosystem multifunctionality. These findings suggest the need for an increased focus on community heterogeneity to reestablish functional ecosystems during restoration.},

  abstract = {Efficient extraction of soil water is essential for the productivity of plant communities. However, research on the complementary use of resources in mixed plant communities, and especially the impact of plant species richness on root water uptake, is limited. So far, these investigations have been hindered by a lack of methods allowing for the estimation of root water uptake profiles. The overarching aim of our study was to determine whether diverse grassland plant communities in general exploit soil water more deeply and whether this shift occurs all the time or only during times of enhanced water demand. Root water uptake was derived by analysing the diurnal decrease in soil water content separately at each measurement depth, thus yielding root water uptake profiles for 12 experimental grasslands communities with two different levels of species richness (4 and 16 sown species). Additional measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and root traits were used to identify differences in water relations between plant functional groups. Although the vertical root distribution did not differ between diversity levels, root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60 cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit. Our results indicate that the more diverse communities were able to adjust their root water uptake, resulting in increased water uptake per root area compared to less diverse communities (52\% at 20 cm, 118\% at 30 cm, and 570\% at 60 cm depth) and a more even distribution of water uptake over depth. Tall herbs, which had lower leaf water potential and higher stomatal conductance in more diverse mixtures, contributed disproportionately to dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake. This study underpins the role of diversity in stabilizing ecosystem function and mitigating drought stress effects during future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that root water uptake is not solely controlled by root length density distribution in communities with high plant diversity but also by spatial shifts in water acquisition.

  abstract = {Motivation Trait data are fundamental to the quantitative description of plant form and function. Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides ready-to-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks. Main types of variables contained GRooT contains 114,222 trait records on 38 continuous root traits. Spatial location and grain Global coverage with data from arid, continental, polar, temperate and tropical biomes. Data on root traits were derived from experimental studies and field studies. Time period and grain Data were recorded between 1911 and 2019. Major taxa and level of measurement GRooT includes root trait data for which taxonomic information is available. Trait records vary in their taxonomic resolution, with subspecies or varieties being the highest and genera the lowest taxonomic resolution available. It contains information for 184 subspecies or varieties, 6,214 species, 1,967 genera and 254 families. Owing to variation in data sources, trait records in the database include both individual observations and mean values. Software format GRooT includes two csv files. A GitHub repository contains the csv files and a script in R to query the database.},

  abstract = {The effects of grazing on grassland ecosystems must be understood to develop effective soil conservation measures and sustain livestock production. The objective of this research was to characterize the impact of dairy cow grazing intensity on C and N in soil and vegetation on a meadow steppe. The meadow steppe site, located near Hailaer, Inner Mongolia, China, has been grazed by dairy cattle for more than 30 years, with the last 23 years managed by the same herders. The study site never received any form of mineral fertilizer. Grazing intensity was classified as light (LG), moderate (MG) and heavy (HG) according to the vegetation utilization rate. Grazing affected biomass, total N (TN) and 15N levels, but not 13C, of above-ground plants. The above-ground biomass and {$\delta$}15N decreased but TN content increased with the grazing intensity for all nine non-legume species while five legume species were not affected. Coarse root biomass also decreased with grazing intensity while TN or {$\delta$}15N responses to grazing showed no consistent patterns. Soil OC and total N content decreased significantly with grazing intensity for all three sampling depths (0\textendash 10, 10\textendash 20 and 20\textendash 30~cm) while nitrate, ammonium and 13C levels were not affected by grazing intensity in all sampling depths. The decreases in soil OC suggest carbon storage in the meadow steppe declined as grazing intensity increased. Combined with the decreases in soil TN content, this also means heavy grazing could lead to decreases in soil quality and fertility. Uneven grazing intensity is an inherent feature of a season-long grazing system and there are risks to soil quality and environmental health associated with HG. We need to find the proper balance between light to heavy grazing intensity through proper grazing management and in some cases using judicious herding to distribute livestock. Some combination of HG, MG and LG could be desirable in sustainable rangeland grazing production.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play important roles in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. The impact of increasing N deposition on AM fungi will inevitably affect ecosystem processes. However, generalizable patterns of how N deposition affects AM fungi remains poorly understood. Here we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis from 94 publications and 101 sites to investigate the responses of AM fungi to N addition, including abundance in both intra-radical (host roots) and extra-radical portion (soil), richness and diversity. We also explored the mechanisms of N addition affecting AM fungi by the trait-based guilds method. Results showed that N addition significantly decreased AM fungal overall abundance (-8.0\%). However, the response of abundance in intra-radical portion was not consistent with that in extra-radical portion: root colonization decreased (-11.6\%) significantly, whereas extra-radical hyphae length density did not change significantly. Different AM fungal guilds showed different responses to N addition: both the abundance (spore density) and relative abundance of the rhizophilic guild decreased significantly under N addition (-29.8\% and -12.0\%, respectively), while the abundance and relative abundance of the edaphophilic guild had insignificant response to N addition. Such inconsistent responses of rhizophilic and edaphophilic guilds were mainly moderated by the change of soil pH and the response of root biomass, respectively. Moreover, N addition had an insignificant negative effect on AM fungal richness and diversity, which was strongly related with the relative availability of soil P (i.e. soil available N/P ratio). Collectively, this meta-analysis highlights that considering trait-based AM fungal guilds, soil P availability and host plant C allocation can greatly improve our understanding of the nuanced dynamics of AM fungal communities under increasing N deposition.},

  abstract = {With increasing affluence in many developing countries, the demand for livestock products is rising and the increasing feed requirement contributes to pressure on land resources for food and energy production. However, there is currently a knowledge gap in our ability to assess the extent and intensity of the utilization of land by livestock, which is the single largest land use in the world. We developed a spatial model that combines fine-scale livestock numbers with their associated energy requirements to distribute livestock grazing demand onto a map of energy supply, with the aim of estimating where and to what degree pasture is being utilized. We applied our model to Kazakhstan, which contains large grassland areas that historically have been used for extensive livestock production but for which the current extent, and thus the potential for increasing livestock production, is unknown. We measured the grazing demand of Kazakh livestock in 2015 at 286 Petajoules, which was 25\% of the estimated maximum sustainable energy supply that is available to livestock for grazing. The model resulted in a grazed area of 1.22 million km2, or 48\% of the area theoretically available for grazing in Kazakhstan, with most utilized land grazed at low intensities (average off-take rate was 13\% of total biomass energy production). Under a conservative scenario, our estimations showed a production potential of 0.13 million tons of beef additional to 2015 production (31\% increase), and much more with utilization of distant pastures. This model is an important step forward in evaluating pasture use and available land resources, and can be adapted at any spatial scale for any region in the world.},

  abstract = {The Central Asian forest-steppe ecotone has been exposed to large alterations in grazing pressure in the last two decades, but the consequences for biodiversity have not been studied so far. We analyzed the biodiversity of the edges and the interior of Siberian larch forests in the forest-steppes of eastern Kazakhstan (Saur, Kazakh Altai) and western Mongolia (Mongolian Altai, Khangai) across different groups of organisms (vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, soil macroarthropods, oribatid mites, moths). The species richness of these groups was related to each other only at the forest edge, but not in the interior. Species richness of vascular plants, soil macroarthropods and oribatid mites at the forest edges was positively correlated. This indicates that these ground-inhabiting groups of organisms responded similarly to the variation in the grazing pressure of livestock, which is kept at spatially varying densities by mostly nomadic or transhumant herders. The species richness of epiphytic lichens was only positively correlated with that of vascular plants, and the richness of the (volant) moths was not correlated with that of any other group. The complete lack of correlation between the diversity of groups of organisms in the forest interior suggests that the diversity of the five studied groups is controlled by specific environmental factors, including light and moisture. Except for the Mongolian Altai, which was subjected to the highest grazing pressure, vascular plants, lichens, soil macroarthropods, and moths had a higher diversity at the edges than in the interior; the opposite was true for the oribatid mites. The latter probably benefit from the higher soil moisture inside the forest, whereas the other four groups are favored by increased availability of light, the proximity to the steppe with a partial mixing of species pools, and the soil macroarthropods also by increased dung abundance.},

  abstract = {Insurance effects of biodiversity can stabilize the functioning of multispecies ecosystems against environmental variability when differential species' responses lead to asynchronous population dynamics. When responses are not perfectly positively correlated, declines in some populations are compensated by increases in others, smoothing variability in ecosystem productivity. This variance reduction effect of biodiversity is analogous to the risk-spreading benefits of diverse investment portfolios in financial markets. We use data from the BIODEPTH network of grassland biodiversity experiments to perform a general test for stabilizing effects of plant diversity on the temporal variability of individual species, functional groups, and aggregate communities. We tested three potential mechanisms: reduction of temporal variability through population asynchrony; enhancement of long-term average performance through positive selection effects; and increases in the temporal mean due to overyielding. Our results support a stabilizing effect of diversity on the temporal variability of grassland aboveground annual net primary production through two mechanisms. Two-species communities with greater population asynchrony were more stable in their average production over time due to compensatory fluctuations. Overyielding also stabilized productivity by increasing levels of average biomass production relative to temporal variability. However, there was no evidence for a performance-enhancing effect on the temporal mean through positive selection effects. In combination with previous work, our results suggest that stabilizing effects of diversity on community productivity through population asynchrony and overyielding appear to be general in grassland ecosystems.},

However, experimental evidence for soil legacy effects of conditioning plant communities on responding plant communities under natural conditions is lacking. We conditioned 192 grassland plots using six different plant communities with different ratios of grasses and forbs and for different durations. Soil microbial legacies were evident for soil fungi, but not for soil bacteria, while soil abiotic parameters did not significantly change in response to conditioning. The soil legacies affected the composition of the succeeding vegetation. Plant communities with different ratios of grasses and forbs left soil legacies that negatively affected succeeding plants of the same functional type. We conclude that fungal-mediated soil legacy effects play a significant role in vegetation assembly of natural plant communities.},

  abstract = {Grazing lawns are a distinct grassland community type, characterised by short-stature and with their persistence and spread promoted by grazing. In Africa, they reveal a long co-evolutionary history of grasses and large mammal grazers. The attractiveness to grazers of a low-biomass sward lies in the relatively high quality of forage, largely due to the low proportion of stem material in the sward; this encourages repeat grazing that concomitantly suppresses tall-grass growth forms that would otherwise outcompete lawn species for light. Regular grazing that prevents shading and maintains sward quality is thus the cornerstone of grazing lawn dynamics. The strong interplay between abiotic conditions and disturbance factors, which are central to grazing lawn existence, can also cause these systems to be highly dynamic. Here we identify differences in growth form among grazing lawn grass species, and assess how compositional differences among lawn types, as well as environmental variables, influence their maintenance requirements (i.e. grazing frequency) and vulnerability to degradation. We also make a clear distinction between the processes of lawn establishment and lawn maintenance. Rainfall, soil nutrient status, grazer community composition and fire regime have strong and interactive influences on both processes. However, factors that concentrate grazing pressure (e.g. nutrient hotspots and sodic sites) have more bearing on where lawns establish. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of enhanced rates of nitrogen cycling and of sodium levels to lawn maintenance. Grazer community composition and density has considerable significance to grazing lawn dynamics; not all grazers are adapted to foraging on short-grass swards, and differences in body size and relative mouth dimensions determine which species are able to convert tall-grass swards into grazing lawns under different conditions. Hence, we evaluate the roles of different grazers in lawn dynamics, as well as the benefits that grazer populations derive from having access to grazing lawns. The effects of grazing lawns can extend well beyond their borders, due to their influence on grazer densities, behaviour and movements as well as fire spread, intensity and frequency. Variation in the area and proportion of a landscape that is grazing lawn can thus have a profound impact on system dynamics. We provide a conceptual model that summarises grazing lawn dynamics, and identify a rainfall range where we predict grazing lawns to be most prevalent. We also examine the biodiversity associated with grazing lawn systems, and consider their functional contribution to the conservation of this biodiversity. Finally, we assess the utility of grazing lawns as a resource in a rangeland context.},

Recent studies have reported widespread decline of vegetation across the steppe and about 70\% of this ecosystem is now considered degraded. Among the scientific community there has been an active debate about whether the observed degradation is related to climate, or over-grazing, or both. Here, we employ a new atmospheric correction and cloud screening algorithm (MAIAC) to investigate trends in satellite observed vegetation phenology. We relate these trends to changes in climate and domestic animal populations. A series of harmonic functions is fitted to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed phenological curves to quantify seasonal and inter-annual changes in vegetation. Our results show a widespread decline (of about 12\% on average) in MODIS observed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) across the country but particularly in the transition zone between grassland and the Gobi desert, where recent decline was as much as 40\% below the 2002 mean NDVI. While we found considerable regional differences in the causes of landscape degradation, about 80\% of the decline in NDVI could be attributed to increase in livestock. Changes in precipitation were able to explain about 30\% of degradation across the country as a whole but up to 50\% in areas with denser vegetation cover (P~{$<~$}0.05). Temperature changes, while significant, played only a minor role (r(2) ~=~0.10, P~{$<~$}0.05). Our results suggest that the cumulative effect of overgrazing is a primary contributor to the degradation of the Mongolian steppe and is at least partially responsible for desertification reported in previous studies.},

However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BDEF). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difficult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of BDEF. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

Fire and herbivores have been hypothesized to play dominant roles in regulating trees in African savannas, but the evidence for this is conflicting. Moving up a trophic scale, the factors that regulate fire occurrence and herbivores, such as disease and predation, are poorly understood for any given ecosystem. We used a Bayesian state-space model to show that the wildebeest population eruption that followed disease (rinderpest) eradication in the Serengeti ecosystem of East Africa led to a widespread reduction in the extent of fire and an ongoing recovery of the tree population. This supports the hypothesis that disease has played a key role in the regulation of this ecosystem. We then link our state-space model with theoretical and empirical results quantifying the effects of grazing and fire on soil carbon to predict that this cascade may have led to important shifts in the size of pools of C stored in soil and biomass. Our results suggest that the dynamics of herbivores and fire are tightly coupled at landscape scales, that fire exerts clear top-down effects on tree density, and that disease outbreaks in dominant herbivores can lead to complex trophic cascades in savanna ecosystems. We propose that the long-term status of the Serengeti and other intensely grazed savannas as sources or sinks for C may be fundamentally linked to the control of disease outbreaks and poaching.},

Research was carried out in four representative test areas, situated in the Ilmen Lake Region and the adjacent Kalmykien Steppe west of the Volga delta. In all test areas significant changes have taken place during the last decade, most of them induced by the abandonment and extensification of former agricultural land use. Most obvious is the sharp decline of irrigated arable land, to less than 5\% of its former extent. Reduced livestock grazing has led to a recovery of formerly degraded desert steppe vegetation in all test areas.In contrast to recent scientific publications and statements of regional and international environmental authorities (UNEP), which assume that desertification risk has even increased after the break down of the Soviet system, our results clearly show the widespread regeneration of formerly altered and degraded land between 1989 and 1998.The dramatic decay of agriculture observed, was induced by the breakdown of the Soviet state farm system, which heavily depended on huge subsidies from the central government. Our findings prove that environmental impacts caused by agriculture, like destruction of natural habitats, salinisation of soils, pasture degradation and wind erosion, have diminished considerably in the last decade, while ecological rehabilitation and the preservation of bio-diversity values are favoured by this development. This seems to apply to large areas in the southern part of the former USSR that have undergone a comparable decline of state ruled agriculture.},

  abstract = {Large-scale patterns of species richness and their causes are still poorly understood for most terrestrial invertebrates, although invertebrates can add important insights into the mechanisms that generate regional and global biodiversity patterns. Here we explore the general plausibility of the climate-based "water-energy dynamics" hypothesis using the latitudinal pattern of land-snail species richness across extensive topographically homogeneous lowlands of northern Eurasia. We established a 1480-km long latitudinal transect across the Western Siberian Plain (Russia) from the Russia-Kazakhstan border (54.5\textdegree N) to the Arctic Ocean (67.5\textdegree N), crossing eight latitudinal vegetation zones: steppe, forest-steppe, subtaiga, southern, middle and northern taiga, forest-tundra, and tundra. We sampled snails in forests and open habitats each half-degree of latitude and used generalized linear models to relate snail species richness to climatic variables and soil calcium content measured in situ. Contrary to the classical prediction of latitudinal biodiversity decrease, we found a striking unimodal pattern of snail species richness peaking in the subtaiga and southern-taiga zones between 57 and 59\textdegree N. The main south-to-north interchange of the two principal diversity constraints, i.e. drought stress vs. cold stress, explained most of the variance in the latitudinal diversity pattern. Water balance, calculated as annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration, was a single variable that could explain 81.7\% of the variance in species richness. Our data suggest that the "water-energy dynamics" hypothesis can apply not only at the global scale but also at subcontinental scales of higher latitudes, as water availability was found to be the primary limiting factor also in this extratropical region with summer-warm and dry climate. A narrow zone with a sharp south-to-north switch in the two main diversity constraints seems to constitute the dominant and general pattern of terrestrial diversity across a large part of northern Eurasia, resulting in a subcontinental diversity hotspot of various taxa in this zone.},

However, slow responses by ecosystems after transgressing a dangerous threshold also affords borrowed time - a window of opportunity to return to safer conditions before the new state eventually locks in and equilibrates.

  abstract = {Background The central thesis of plant ecology is that climate determines the global distribution of vegetation. Within a vegetation type, however, finer-scale environmental features, such as the physical and chemical properties of soil (edaphic variation), control patterns of plant diversity and distributions. Aims Here, we review the literature to provide a mechanistic framework for the edaphic control of plant diversity. First, we review three examples where soils have known, prevalent effects on plant diversity: during soil formation, on unusual soils and in regions with high edaphic heterogeneity. Second, we synthesize how edaphic factors mediate the relative importance of the four key processes of community assembly (speciation, ecological drift, dispersal and niche selection). Third, we review the potential effects of climate change in edaphically heterogeneous regions. Finally, we outline key knowledge gaps for understanding the edaphic control of plant diversity. In our review, we emphasize floras of unusual edaphic areas (i.e., serpentine, limestone, granite), because these areas contribute disproportionately to the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Taxa Terrestrial plants. Location Global. Conclusion Edaphic variation is a key driver of biodiversity patterns and influences the relative importance of speciation, dispersal, ecological drift, niche selection and interactions among these processes. Research is still needed to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which edaphic variation influences these community assembly processes, and unusual soils provide excellent natural systems for such tests. Furthermore, the incorporation of edaphic variation into climate change research will help to increase the predictive power of species distribution models, identify potential climate refugia and identify species with adaptations that buffer them from climate change.},

  abstract = {Although the influence of nitrogen (N) addition on grassland plant communities has been widely studied, it is still unclear whether observed patterns and underlying mechanisms are constant across biomes. In this systematic review, we use meta-analysis and metaregression to investigate the influence of N addition (here referring mostly to fertilization) upon the biodiversity of temperate mountain grasslands (including montane, subalpine and alpine zones). Forty-two studies met our criteria of inclusion, resulting in 134 measures of effect size. The main general responses of mountain grasslands to N addition were increases in phytomass and reductions in plant species richness, as observed in lowland grasslands. More specifically, the analysis reveals that negative effects on species richness were exacerbated by dose (ha-1 year-1) and duration of N application (years) in an additive manner. Thus, sustained application of low to moderate levels of N over time had effects similar to short-term application of high N doses. The climatic context also played an important role: the overall effects of N addition on plant species richness and diversity (Shannon index) were less pronounced in mountain grasslands experiencing cool rather than warm summers. Furthermore, the relative negative effect of N addition on species richness was more pronounced in managed communities and was strongly negatively related to N-induced increases in phytomass, that is the greater the phytomass response to N addition, the greater the decline in richness. Altogether, this review not only establishes that plant biodiversity of mountain grasslands is negatively affected by N addition, but also demonstrates that several local management and abiotic factors interact with N addition to drive plant community changes. This synthesis yields essential information for a more sustainable management of mountain grasslands, emphasizing the importance of preserving and restoring grasslands with both low agricultural N application and limited exposure to N atmospheric deposition.},

Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversity-dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c. 2\textendash 21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversity-dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {A major question in ecology is to know how ecosystem function is affected by the number of species. After two decades of research, the nature, shape, and causes of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain unresolved. Huston () suggested that a statistical `sampling effect' for a few dominant species produced the patterns observed in experiments, while Tilman et al. () argued that the observed responses were due to the number of species rather than the properties of a few. Here, we present a general, theoretical and parsimonious model using combinatorial probabilities to describe the assembly effect as a probabilistic process. Our basic assumption is that community function is determined by random drawing from a fixed species pool composed of three classes of species. The species classes differ in their effect on community function and are ordered in a simple dominance hierarchy (subordinate, dominant and super-dominant species). Community function is determined by prevalent dominance rules: the dominance by the majority of species mimics the effect of dominant species, i.e. the function is determined by the dominant or super-dominant species class the most numerous within the community; the dominance by the presence of species mimics the effect of keystone species, i.e. the function is determined by the species that is ranked highest in the dominance hierarchy. The model produces significant fits to four experimental data sets obtained for plant and microbial communities, including monotonic and hump-shaped curves. The results indicate that the model gave good fits under both the dominance rules in any data set, suggesting that the random sampling effect provides a parsimonious explanation for the various relationships observed in diversity-ecosystem functioning experiments. The model describes a random assembly process that produces variation in ecosystem functioning in response to number of species selected from a regional species pool composed of several classes of species differing in their ecosystem effects and relative dominance. This simple model reproduces all shapes of diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships reported in the experimental literature. The results suggest that the multi-faceted response of ecosystems to biodiversity may be nothing more than manifestations of random assembly effects and variation in species properties.},

  abstract = {1. Despite aspirations for conservation impact, mismatches between research and implementation have limited progress towards this goal. There is, therefore, an urgent need to identify how we can more effectively navigate the spaces between research and practice. 2. In 2014, we ran a workshop with conservation researchers and practitioners to identify mismatches between research and implementation that needed to be overcome to deliver evidence-informed conservation action. Five mismatches were highlighted: spatial, temporal, priority, communication, and institutional. 3. Since 2014, thinking around the `research\textendash implementation gap' has progressed. The term `gap' has been replaced by language around the dynamic `spaces' between research and action, representing a shift in thinking around what it takes to better align research and practice. 4. In 2019, we ran a follow-up workshop reflecting on this shift, whether the five mismatches identified in the 2014 workshop were still present in conservation, and whether progress had been made to overcome these mismatches during the past 5 years. We found that while there has been progress, we still have some way to go across all dimensions. 5. Here, we report on the outcomes of the 2019 workshop, reflect on what has changed over the past 5 years, and offer 10 recommendations for strengthening the alignment of conservation research and practice.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem stability is threatened by multiple global change factors such as drought and elevated nitrogen deposition. Yet, it is still poorly understood whether soil organisms can buffer against such perturbations. Here we focus on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a common and widespread group of soil fungi. AMF form symbiotic associations with the majority of terrestrial land plants and promote a range of ecosystem services including plant production, diversity and nutrient cycling. We tested whether AMF have the ability to enhance the resistance and resilience of plant communities under soil moisture deficit (hereby drought) and nitrogen deposition. Grassland microcosms with 11 different plant species were established with and without AMF and exposed to elevated nitrogen levels and to an intermittent period of drought. Drought strongly reduced plant productivity and nitrogen cycling, but had limited effects on plant diversity. Nitrogen enrichment reduced plant diversity and increased nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions. The presence of AMF enhanced plant productivity, plant diversity and reduced nitrogen losses. AMF facilitated the resistance of plant productivity and nitrogen cycling to drought and the recovery of the plant community structure back to its pre drought state. Furthermore, AMF also mitigated the adverse effects of nitrogen enrichment on the resistance of multiple ecosystem functions to drought. Synthesis. Our work highlights the integral role of AMF for the stability of ecosystem functioning; AMF are not only able to promote resistance to harsh conditions of global change but also improve resilience by enabling plant communities to recover. These findings underline AMF's insurance capacity to buffer ecosystems against global change.},

We investigated the mechanisms and impact of the translocation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) along AM fungal hyphae in bespoke microcosms. An in vitro culture experiment was also conducted to determine the direct impact of hyphal exudates of AM fungi upon the growth of PSB. The extraradical hyphae of AM fungi can transport PSB to organic phosphorus (P) patches and enhance organic P mineralization both under in vitro culture and soil conditions. Bacteria move in a thick water film formed around fungal hyphae. However, the bacteria cannot be transferred to the organic P patch without an energy source in the form of hyphal exudates. Our results could be harnessed to better manage plant microbe interactions and improve the ability of biological inocula involving AM fungi and bacteria to enhance the sustainability of agricultural crops in P limited conditions.},

  abstract = {Large vertebrates affect fire regimes in several ways: by consuming plant matter that would otherwise accumulate as fuel; by controlling and varying the density of vegetation; and by engineering the soil and litter layer. These processes can regulate the frequency, intensity and extent of fire. The evidence for these effects is strongest in environments with intermediate rainfall, warm temperatures and graminoid-dominated ground vegetation. Probably, extinction of Quaternary megafauna triggered increased biomass burning in many such environments. Recent and continuing declines of large vertebrates are likely to be significant contributors to changes in fire regimes and vegetation that are currently being experienced in many parts of the world. To date, rewilding projects that aim to restore large herbivores have paid little attention to the value of large animals in moderating fire regimes. Rewilding potentially offers a powerful tool for managing the risks of wildfire and its impacts on natural and human values.This article is part of the theme issue 'Trophic rewilding: consequences for ecosystems under global change'.},

However, such programmes often require the active introduction of wildflower seed or plants to achieve rapid increases in diversity. Methods need to be developed for the successful establishment of desirable species into existing species-poor swards and the implications of using different seed provenances need to be considered. The establishment of five common forb species were compared, each represented by two provenances, sown into a range of swards each receiving different management regimes. For each species, one provenance was collected locally and the other was of non-local, commercially-obtained, provenance. Two years after sowing, the unfertilised sward management with two cuts per year followed by aftermath grazing showed the greatest seedling establishment; that with cutting alone showed the least, even less than the management receiving fertiliser inputs and continuous grazing. Seedling survivorship was related more to sward management than to fine-scale sward composition. Within some species there were significant differences in survival between provenances. The importance of sward management and species provenance in grassland restoration programmes are discussed.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S\o rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita\textendash Horn index as special cases.},

  abstract = {Almost half a century after Whittaker (Ecol Monogr 30:279-338, 1960) proposed his influential diversity concept, it is time for a critical reappraisal. Although the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity introduced by Whittaker have become general textbook knowledge, the concept suffers from several drawbacks. First, alpha and gamma diversity share the same characteristics and are differentiated only by the scale at which they are applied. However, as scale is relative--depending on the organism(s) or ecosystems investigated--this is not a meaningful ecological criterion. Alpha and gamma diversity can instead be grouped together under the term "inventory diversity." Out of the three levels proposed by Whittaker, beta diversity is the one which receives the most contradictory comments regarding its usefulness ("key concept" vs. "abstruse concept"). Obviously beta diversity means different things to different people. Apart from the large variety of methods used to investigate it, the main reason for this may be different underlying data characteristics. A literature review reveals that the multitude of measures used to assess beta diversity can be sorted into two conceptually different groups. The first group directly takes species distinction into account and compares the similarity of sites (similarity indices, slope of the distance decay relationship, length of the ordination axis, and sum of squares of a species matrix). The second group relates species richness (or other summary diversity measures) of two (or more) different scales to each other (additive and multiplicative partitioning). Due to that important distinction, we suggest that beta diversity should be split into two levels, "differentiation diversity" (first group) and "proportional diversity" (second group). Thus, we propose to use the terms "inventory diversity" for within-sample diversity, "differentiation diversity" for compositional similarity between samples, and "proportional diversity" for the comparison of inventory diversity across spatial and temporal scales.},

We outline the digression and demutation stages of steppe and sandy-steppe pastures and identify the features of their similarity and difference associated with resistance to grazing pressure. It is shown that overgrazing and underutilization decrease their natural potential.

Although restoration ecology has been rapidly evolving as a scientific discipline, the principles that have developed regarding aboveground-belowground linkages have yet to be thoroughly integrated into it. In this review, we conceptually integrate the role of aboveground-belowground linkages with the principles of restoration ecology through a framework that transcends multiple levels of ecological organization, and illustrate its application through three examples: restoration of abandoned land, reversal of biological invasions, and restoration of natural disturbances. We conclude that this integration can greatly assist restoration ecology, through aiding identification of effective invention practices and prediction of ecosystem recovery.},

  abstract = {Soil and vegetation degradation around watering points has been observed in many drylands around the world. It can be recognized in spaceborne imagery as radial brightness belts fading as a function of distance from the water wells. The primary goal of the study was to characterize spatial and temporal land degradation/rehabilitation in the Central Asian drylands. Tasseled Cap's brightness index was found to be the best spectral transformation for enhancing the contrast between the bright-degraded areas close to the wells and the darker surrounding areas far from and in-between these wells. Semi-variograms were derived to understand the spatial structure present in the spaceborne imagery of two desert sites and in three key time periods (mid-late 1970s, around 1990, and 2000). A geostatistical model, namely the kriging interpolation technique, was applied for smoothing brightness index values extracted from 30 to 80~m spatial resolution images in order to assess spatial and temporal land-cover patterns. Change detection analysis, based on the kriging prediction maps, was performed to assess the direction and intensity of changes between the study periods. These findings were linked to the socio-economic situation before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union that influenced the grazing pressure and hence the land-use/land-cover state of the study sites.The study found that degradation occurred in some areas due to recent exploration and exploitation of the gas and oil reserves in the region. Another area was subject to rehabilitation of the rangeland due to a dramatic decrease in the number of livestock due to socio-economical changes after the independence of Kazakhstan in 1991.},

Distinguishing between traits that are adaptations originating in response to fire or exaptations originating in response to other factors might not always be possible. However, fire has been a factor throughout the history of land-plant evolution and is not strictly a Neogene phenomenon. Mesozoic fossils show evidence of fire-adaptive traits and, in some lineages, these might have persisted to the present as fire adaptations.},

  abstract = {Question: Explaining the biomass\textendash species richness relationship is key to understanding vegetation dynamics. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested, but complex analysis of plant strategies, major biomass and species richness components along a long productivity gradient is still lacking. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between major biomass components (total above-ground biomass, green biomass and litter), plant strategies and species richness along a long gradient of alkali and loess grasslands in a steppe landscape in Central Europe.  Location: Hortobagy, Great Hungarian Plain, East Hungary.  Methods: Above-ground biomass of characteristic alkali and loess grassland stands was sampled along a gradient of increasing productivity. In each grassland stand, a 25-m2 sample site was randomly selected. Within each site, ten aboveground biomass samples (20 9 20 cm) were collected randomly in June 2009, at the peak of biomass production. We classified all species into mixed C-S-R strategy types. To obtain correlations between various biomass and species richness data, Spearman rank correlation was used. The relationship between plant strategies and species compositionwere displayed with a DCA ordination.  Results: The frequently detected humped-back relationship was valid for the relation of total biomass and species richness. With increasing amount of total biomass, we detected an increasing proportion of competitors, and a decreasing proportion of stress tolerators in green biomass. A low proportion of ruderals was detected at both low and high biomass levels. Species richness was affected positively by litter at low litter scores, but there was a negative litter effect from much lower scores than detected previously (from 400 gm2). There was a positive relationship between green biomass production and species richness.  Conclusions: The study revealed that at the initial part of a productivity gradient, stress is likely responsible for low species richness. Our results show that litter can shape changes in species richness along the whole biomass gradient, thus the litter effect is one of the major mechanisms structuring grassland diversity.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian rangelands contain the world's largest contiguous pasture area, grazed for millennia by mobile pastoralists' livestock. This paper reviews evidence from one Eurasian country, Kazakhstan, of how nomadic pastoralism developed from some 5,000 years ago to the present. We consider a timespan from pre-industrial, socialist and capitalist periods, during which pastoral social formations shifted from clans, to state employees to private farm families and ranchers. The aim is to understand how events over the last hundred years have led to sequential dissolution and re-formation of the social units necessary to manage livestock across the geographical scale of spatially heterogenous and seasonally variable ecosystems. It is argued that the social scale of extensive livestock management must be tailored to the geographical scale of the biotic and abiotic conditions. The paper briefly appraises archaeological data indicating the long duration of mobile pastoralism in the Kazakh rangelands. The middle sections then provide an overview of how events from the late 17th C onwards unravelled the relationships between Kazakh nomads' socio-economic units of livestock management and the rangeland environment. At present, mobile animal husbandry is not feasible for the majority of Kazakh livestock owners, who operate solely within small family units without state support. These reformulated post-Soviet livestock grazing patterns are still undergoing rapid change, influencing the balance between vegetation communities, wildlife and carbon, as ecological publications show. In conclusion, there is trend that by concentrating capital and landed resources onto a minority of large-scale pastoralists, a few can re-extensify through mobility in combination with selective intensification, such as more reliance on cultivated feed. Unfortunately, current state and international efforts are leaving out the majority of small-scale livestock owners and their livestock who are unable to adopt either practice at sufficient scale, leading to more environmental damage and social inequity in the future.},

  abstract = {Plant species richness of permanent grasslands has often been found to be significantly associated with productivity. Concentrations of nutrients in biomass can give further insight into these productivity- plant species richness relationships, e.g. by reflecting land use or soil characteristics. However, the consistency of such relationships across different regions has rarely been taken into account, which might significantly compromise our potential for generalization. We recorded plant species richness and measured above-ground biomass and concentrations of nutrients in biomass in 295 grasslands in three regions in Germany that differ in soil and climatic conditions. Structural equation modelling revealed that nutrient concentrations were mostly indirectly associated with plant species richness via biomass production. However, negative associations between the concentrations of different nutrients and biomass and plant species richness differed considerably among regions. While in two regions, more than 40\% of the variation in plant species richness could be attributed to variation in biomass, K, P, and to some degree also N concentrations, in the third region only 15\% of the variation could be explained in this way. Generally, highest plant species richness was recorded in grasslands where N and P were co-limiting plant growth, in contrast to N or K (co-) limitation. But again, this pattern was not recorded in the third region. While for two regions land-use intensity and especially the application of fertilizers are suggested to be the main drivers causing the observed negative associations with productivity, in the third region the little variance accounted for, low species richness and weak relationships implied that former intensive grassland management, ongoing mineralization of peat and fluctuating water levels in fen grasslands have overruled effects of current land-use intensity and productivity. Finally, we conclude that regional replication is of major importance for studies seeking general insights into productivity-diversity relationships.},

  abstract = {Distinguishing organic and conventional products is a major issue of food security and authenticity. Previous studies successfully used stable isotopes to separate organic and conventional products, but up to now, this approach was not tested for organic grassland hay and soil. Moreover, isotopic abundances could be a powerful tool to elucidate differences in ecosystem functioning and driving mechanisms of element cycling in organic and conventional management systems. Here, we studied the {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C isotopic composition of soil and hay samples of 21 organic and 34 conventional grasslands in two German regions. We also used {$\Delta\delta$}15N ({$\delta$}15N plant - {$\delta$}15N soil) to characterize nitrogen dynamics. In order to detect temporal trends, isotopic abundances in organic grasslands were related to the time since certification. Furthermore, discriminant analysis was used to test whether the respective management type can be deduced from observed isotopic abundances. Isotopic analyses revealed no significant differences in {$\delta$}13C in hay and {$\delta$}15N in both soil and hay between management types, but showed that {$\delta$}13C abundances were significantly lower in soil of organic compared to conventional grasslands. {$\Delta\delta$}15N values implied that management types did not substantially differ in nitrogen cycling. Only {$\delta$}13C in soil and hay showed significant negative relationships with the time since certification. Thus, our result suggest that organic grasslands suffered less from drought stress compared to conventional grasslands most likely due to a benefit of higher plant species richness, as previously shown by manipulative biodiversity experiments. Finally, it was possible to correctly classify about two third of the samples according to their management using isotopic abundances in soil and hay. However, as more than half of the organic samples were incorrectly classified, we infer that more research is needed to improve this approach before it can be efficiently used in practice.},

  abstract = {The intensification of land use constitutes one of the main drivers of global change and alters nutrient fluxes on all spatial scales, causing landscape-level eutrophication and contamination of natural resources. Changes in soil nutrient concentrations are thus indicative for crucial environmental issues associated with intensive land use. We measured concentrations of NO3 -N, NH4 -N, P, K, Mg, and Ca using 1,326 ion-exchange resin bags buried in 20~cm depth beneath the main root zone in 150 temperate grasslands. Nutrient concentrations were related to land use intensity, that is, fertilization, mowing, grazing intensities, and plant diversity by structural equation~modeling. Furthermore, we assessed the response of soil nutrients to mechanical sward disturbance and subsequent reseeding, a common practice for grassland renewal. Land use intensity, especially fertilization, significantly increased the concentrations of NO3 -N, NH4 -N, K, P, and also Mg. Besides fertilization (and tightly correlated mowing) intensity, grazing strongly increased NO3 -N and K concentrations. Plant species richness decreased P and NO3 -N concentrations in soil when grassland productivity of the actual year was statistically taken into account, but not when long-term averages of productivity were used. Thus, we assume that, in the actual study year, a distinct drought period might have caused the observed decoupling of productivity from fertilization and soil nutrients. Breaking up the grassland sward drastically increased NO3 -N concentrations (+146\%) but reduced NH4 -N, P, and K concentrations, unbalancing soil nutrient stoichiometry and boosting the risk of N leaching. Reseeding the sward after disturbance did not have a short-term effect on nutrient concentrations. We conclude that renewal of permanent grassland should be avoided as far as possible and future grassland management has to strongly rise the effectiveness of fertilization. Additionally, grassland management might have to increasingly taking care of periods of drought, in which nutrient additions might not increase plant growth but potentially only facilitate leaching.},

Growing evidence suggests that ecological intensification of mainstream farming can safeguard food production, with accompanying environmental benefits; however, the approach is rarely adopted by farmers. Our review of the evidence for replacing external inputs with ecosystem services shows that scientists tend to focus on processes (e.g., pollination) rather than outcomes (e.g., profits), and express benefits at spatio-temporal scales that are not always relevant to farmers. This results in mismatches in perceived benefits of ecological intensification between scientists and farmers, which hinders its uptake. We provide recommendations for overcoming these mismatches and highlight important additional factors driving uptake of nature-based management practices, such as social acceptability of farming.},

  abstract = {1. In herbaceous communities (which host many perennial species), belowground clonal organs and traits remain largely overlooked in ecosystem functioning studies. However, the belowground compartment is expected to play a key role as the greatest proportion of biomass is allocated belowground. Our main goal was to test whether including underexplored clonal traits (in-tandem with widely used aboveground traits) improves the ability to predict biomass production and soil carbon in temperate grasslands. We examined the relationships between five plant functional traits (canopy height, specific leaf area, lateral spread, multiplication rate, persistence of rhizome) and biomass allocation (aboveground, roots, rhizomes) and soil organic carbon. 2. We studied 52 grassland plots clustered in two Central European regions differing by management intensity. We assessed biomass allocated aboveground and belowground (into roots and rhizomes separately). Soil organic carbon was measured from averaging five soil cores at each plot. Trait community means were calculated for each trait from species compositions using databases. 3. The most important traits in predicting biomass allocation were canopy height and persistence of rhizome. Results, however, differed for the two regions implying context dependency of the relationships. Persistence of rhizome and canopy height emerged as traits largely affecting ecosystem functioning at the less intensively managed grasslands \textendash{} likely because of their links to biomass production and plant economics spectrum. At the more intensively managed grasslands, canopy height and specific leaf area were negatively correlated with root biomass, with persistence of rhizome playing a (lesser) role. We found no significant predictors for soil organic carbon. 4. Synthesis. This study is the first attempt to integrate belowground clonal and aboveground traits to predict biomass allocation and soil carbon. Findings indicate that the ability of plant functional traits in predicting ecosystem functioning is highly context dependent, varying greatly even within the same community type. Only SLA and, to a lesser extent, persistence of rhizome consistently predicted root biomass in the two regions. We call for a broader implementon of the whole-plant multifunctional approach applied here, ideally extending to other open ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Successful establishment of plants is limited by both biotic and abiotic conditions and their interactions. Seedling establishment is also used as a direct measure of habitat suitability, but transient changes in vegetation might provide windows of opportunity allowing plant species to colonize sites which otherwise appear unsuitable. We aimed to study spatio-temporal variability in the effects of resident vegetation on establishment, growth and reproduction of dry grassland species in abandoned arable fields representing potentially suitable habitats. Seeds were sown in disturbed (bare of vegetation and roots) and undisturbed plots in three fields abandoned in the last 20 years. To assess the effects of temporal variation on plant establishment, we initiated our experiments in two years (2007 and 2008). Seventeen out of the 35 sown species flowered within two years after sowing, while three species completely failed to become established. The vegetation in the undisturbed plots facilitated seedling establishment only in the year with low spring precipitation, and the effect did not hold for all species. In contrast, growth and flowering rate were consistently much greater in the disturbed plots, but the effect size differed between the fields and years of sowing. We show that colonization is more successful when site opening by disturbance coincide with other suitable conditions such as weather or soil characteristics. Seasonal variability involved in our study emphasizes the necessity of temporal replication of sowing experiments. Studies assessing habitat suitability by seed sowing should either involve both vegetation removal treatments and untreated plots or follow the gradient of vegetation cover. We strongly recommend following the numbers of established individuals, their sizes and reproductive success when assessing habitat suitability by seed sowing since one can gain completely different results in different phases of plant life cycle.},

The second identifies the effects of species replacements (losses and/or gains of species relative to the baseline polyculture) as well as the indirect effects on other species' productivity. We compare and contrast these two approaches using simulated communities where species compete for different resource types and experience different levels of environmental heterogeneity and find that these metrics can jointly diagnose the mechanisms of competition driving productivity. We apply our methods to data from a long-term biodiversity-ecosystem experiment (the Jena Experiment) and find that the data do not correspond to any of the competition scenarios we modeled. We address two additional possible complications: facilitation by nitrogen fixing plants, and non-equilibrium behavior during community assembly, and find that facilitation/competition by nitrogen fixing plants is the more likely explanation for the results obtained at Jena.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

As a result Kazakhstan became an important breadbasket ofthe former SovietUnion.However, the collapse ofthe Soviet Union in1991 triggered widespread agricultural abandonment, andmuch cropland reverted to grasslands.Our goal in this studywas to reconstruct and analyze agricultural land-cover change since the eveoftheVirgin LandsCampaign, from1953 to 2010 in KostanayProvince, a region that is representative ofNorthern Kazakhstan. Further,we assessed the potential ofcurrently idle cropland for re-cultivation. Wereconstructed the cropland extent before and after theVirgin Lands Campaign using archivalmaps, andwemapped the agricultural land cover in the late Soviet andpost-Soviet period usingmulti-seasonal LandsatTM/ETM+ images fromcirca 1990, 2000 and 2010.Cropland extent peaked at approximately 3.1Mha in our studyarea in 1990,38\%ofwhichhad been converted fromgrasslands from1954 to 1961. After the collapse ofthe SovietUnion,45\%ofthe Soviet croplandwas abandoned andhad reverted to grassland by2000. After 2000, cropland contraction and re-cultivation were balanced.Using spatial logistic regressionswe found that cropland expansion during theVirgin LandsCampaignwas significantlyassociated with favorable agro-environmental conditions. In contrast, cropland expansion after theCampaign until 1990, as well as cropland contraction after 1990, occurredmainly in areas that were less favorable for agriculture.Cropland re-cultivation after 2000was occurringonlandswith relatively favorable agro-environmental conditions in comparison to remaining idle croplands, albeit withmuchlower agro-environmental endowment compared to stable croplands from1990 to 2010. In sum,we found that croplandproduction potentials ofthe currently uncultivated areas are muchlower thancommonlybelieved, and further cropland expansion is onlypossible at the expense ofmarginal lands. Our results suggest ifincreasing production is a goal, improving crop yields in currentlycultivated lands should be a focus, whereas extensive livestock grazing aswell as the conservation ofnonprovisioning ecosystem services andbiodiversityshould be priorityonmore marginal lands.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) metrics are widely used to assess invasion ecosystem impacts, but we have limited theory to predict how FD should respond to invasion. A key challenge to effectively using FD metrics is the complexity of conceptualizing alterations to multidimensional trait space, making it difficult to select a priori the most appropriate metric for specific ecological questions. Here, we provide expectations on how invasion should change four commonly used FD metrics\textemdash functional richness (FRic), evenness (FEve), divergence (FDiv) and dispersion (FDis)\textemdash and then test these expectations in a laboratory decomposition experiment. We simulate invasion of a forest by understorey plants by adding leaf litter from 18 natives and non-natives to a representative canopy tree litter mixture to test changes in FD and decomposition. All four metrics changed predictably with invasion. Species that were more functionally unique or when added at greater proportions had larger impacts on FD. Overall, FRic, FEve and FDiv were poor choices for understanding impacts of non-native species. FDis was the only metric that both changed predictably with addition of understorey litter and correlated intuitively with changes in carbon mineralization. Furthermore, ranking species based upon how much they changed FDis of the litter mixture provided a fair assessment of which species had the largest impact on decomposition. As such, functional dispersion may be a key tool for predicting a priori which non-natives will have the greatest impact on ecosystem processes. Synthesis. We highlight the need to assess the suitability of each functional diversity metric for the specific ecological question at hand. Our work reveals the pitfalls of considering multiple metrics or randomly choosing a single metric without suitability assessments. At the same time, it suggests a framework for metric assessment that should help lead to selection of a metric or metrics that provide robust a priori insights into how invasion by non-native species can impact ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {The collapse of collective farming in Russia after 1990 and the subsequent economic crisis led to the abandonment of more than 45 million ha of arable lands (23\% of the agricultural area). This was the most widespread and abrupt land use change in the 20th century in the northern hemisphere. The withdrawal of land area from cultivation led to several benefits including carbon (C) sequestration. Here, we provide a geographically complete and spatially detailed analysis of C sequestered in these abandoned lands. The average C accumulation rate in the upper 20~cm of mineral soil was 0.96~{$\pm~$}0.08~Mg~C~ha(-1) ~yr(-1) for the first 20~years after abandonment and 0.19~{$\pm~$}0.10~Mg~C~ha(-1) ~yr(-1) during the next 30~years of postagrogenic evolution and natural vegetation establishment. The amount of C sequestered over the period 1990-2009 accounts to 42.6~{$\pm~$}3.8~Tg~C per year. This C sequestration rate is equivalent to ca. 10\% of the annual C sink in all Russian forests. Furthermore, it compensates all fire and postfire CO2 emissions in Russia and covers about 4\% of the global CO2 release due to deforestation and other land use changes. Our assessment shows a significant mitigation of increasing atmospheric CO2 by prolonged C accumulation in Russian soils caused by collective farming collapse.},

  abstract = {Plants vary widely in how common or rare they are, but whether commonness of species is associated with functional traits is still debated. This might partly be because commonness can be measured at different spatial scales, and because most studies focus solely on aboveground functional traits. We measured five root traits and seed mass on 241 central European grassland species, and extracted their specific leaf area, height, mycorrhizal status and bud-bank size from databases. Then we tested if trait values are associated with commonness at seven spatial scales, ranging from abundance in 16-m2 grassland plots, via regional and European-wide occurrence frequencies, to worldwide naturalization success. At every spatial scale, commonness was associated with at least three traits. The traits explained the greatest proportions of variance for abundance in grassland plots (42\%) and naturalization success (41\%) and the least for occurrence frequencies in Europe and the Mediterranean (2\%). Low root tissue density characterized common species at every scale, whereas other traits showed directional changes depending on the scale. We also found that many of the effects had significant non-linear effects, in most cases with the highest commonness-metric value at intermediate trait values. Across scales, belowground traits explained overall more variance in species commonness (19.4\%) than aboveground traits (12.6\%). The changes we found in the relationships between traits and commonness, when going from one spatial scale to another, could at least partly explain the maintenance of trait variation in nature. Most importantly, our study shows that within grasslands, belowground traits are at least as important as aboveground traits for species commonness. Therefore, belowground traits should be more frequently considered in studies on plant functional ecology.},

Seed farming of native plant species is crucial to meet restoration goals, but may be stymied by the disconnection of academic research in seed science and the lack of effective policies that regulate native seed production/supply. To illustrate this problem, we identified 1,122 plant species important for European grasslands of conservation concern and found that only 32\% have both fundamental seed germination data available and can be purchased as seed. The "restoration species pool," or set of species available in practice, acts as a significant biodiversity selection filter for species use in restoration projects. For improvement, we propose: (1) substantial expansion of research and development on native seed quality, viability, and production; (2) open-source knowledge transfer between sectors; and (3) creation of supportive policy intended to stimulate demand for biodiverse seed.},

These new bias-corrected estimators retain much of the original utility of the response ratio and are aimed to improve the quality and reliability of inferences with effect sizes based on the log ratio of two means.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

This finding challenges the prevailing view that resource competition controls local plant diversity along resource gradients, and instead reflects processes shaping species pools over evolutionary time scales.},

We explored this relationship using long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and radiocarbon ((14)C) modelling. Here we show that higher plant diversity increases rhizosphere carbon inputs into the microbial community resulting in both increased microbial activity and carbon storage. Increases in soil carbon were related to the enhanced accumulation of recently fixed carbon in high-diversity plots, while plant diversity had less pronounced effects on the decomposition rate of existing carbon. The present study shows that elevated carbon storage at high plant diversity is a direct function of the soil microbial community, indicating that the increase in carbon storage is mainly limited by the integration of new carbon into soil and less by the decomposition of existing soil carbon.},

  abstract = {Tallgrass prairie is a disturbance-dependent ecosystem that has suffered steep declines in the midwestern United States. The necessity of disturbance, typically fire or grazing, presents challenges to managers who must apply them on increasingly small and fragmented parcels. The goal of this study was to compare effects of management using cattle grazing or fire on vegetation and soil characteristics to aid managers in making decisions regarding the kind of disturbance to apply. We selected 73 sites, of which 27 were managed solely by cattle grazing and 46 solely by fire, for at least 11 yr leading up to the study. We stratified the sites by prairie type (dry, mesic, and wet) and sampled frequency of plant species on randomly placed transects, supplemented with botanist-directed walks, and collected and composited five soil cores on a randomly selected transect within each prairie type at each site. We calculated rarefied richness and Shannon evenness from the transect data and mean coefficient of conservatism (CofC) from the total list of species. Soil samples were analyzed for texture, bulk density, total N and C, and potential net N nitrification and mineralization. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of the plant community data revealed differences in species associated with mesic and wet prairies, but no separation by management type. Similarly, none of the vegetation variables we calculated varied by management type, as determined by mixed-effects models, but soil bulk density was 17.5\% higher and total N was 22\% higher on grazed sites than burned sites. Sites burned more recently had higher species richness and mean CofC, but fire was not associated with any soil variables. Sites grazed more recently had higher bulk density, total N and C, and faster N cycling rates. Overall, 28\% of plant species were found exclusively in one management type or the other, but these species did not vary in mean CofC.

The response-and-effect trait framework provides a conceptual foundation for translating restoration goals into functional trait targets, but a quantitative framework has been lacking for translating trait targets into assemblages of species that practitioners can actually manipulate. This study describes new trait-based models that can be used to generate ranges of species abundances to test theories about which traits, which trait values and which species assemblages are most effective for achieving functional outcomes. These models are generalisable, flexible tools that can be widely applied across many terrestrial ecosystems. Examples illustrate how the framework generates assemblages of indigenous species to (1) achieve desired community responses by applying the theories of environmental filtering, limiting similarity and competitive hierarchies, or (2) achieve desired effects on ecosystem functions by applying the theories of mass ratios and niche complementarity. Experimental applications of this framework will advance our understanding of how to set functional trait targets to achieve the desired restoration goals. A trait-based framework provides restoration ecology with a robust scaffold on which to apply fundamental ecological theory to maintain resilient and functioning ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.},

  abstract = {The functional traits of organisms within multispecies assemblages regulate biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet how traits should assemble to boost multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) remains poorly explored. In a multibiome litter experiment covering most of the global variation in leaf trait spectra, we showed that three dimensions of functional diversity (dispersion, rarity, and evenness) explained up to 66\% of variations in multifunctionality, although the dominant species and their traits remained an important predictor. While high dispersion impeded multifunctionality, increasing the evenness among functionally dissimilar species was a key dimension to promote higher multifunctionality and to reduce the abundance of plant pathogens. Because too-dissimilar species could have negative effects on ecosystems, our results highlight the need for not only diverse but also functionally even assemblages to promote multifunctionality. The effect of functionally rare species strongly shifted from positive to negative depending on their trait differences with the dominant species. Simultaneously managing the dispersion, evenness, and rarity in multispecies assemblages could be used to design assemblages aimed at maximizing multifunctionality independently of the biome, the identity of dominant species, or the range of trait values considered. Functional evenness and rarity offer promise to improve the management of terrestrial ecosystems and to limit plant disease risks.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the following question: how does one relate the biological and behavioral characteristics of animals to habitat characteristics of the locations at which they are found? Ecologists often assemble data on species composition at different localities, habitat descriptions of these localities, and biological or behavioral traits of the species. These data tables are usually analyzed two by two: species composition against habitat characteristics, or against behavioral data, using such methods as canonical analysis. We propose a solution to the problem of estimating the parameters describing the relationship between habitat characteristics and biology or behavior, and of testing the statistical significance of these parameters; this problem is referred to as the fourth-corner problem, from its matrix formulation. In other words, the fourth-corner method offers a way of analyzing the relationships between the supplementary variables associated with the rows and columns of a binary (presence or absence) data table. The test case that motivated this study concerns a coral reef fish assemblage (280 species). Biological and behavioral characteristics of the species were used as supplementary variables for the rows, and characteristics of the environment for the columns. Parameters of the association between habitat characteristics (distance from beach, water depth, and substrate variables) and biological and behavioral traits of the species (feeding habits, ecological niche categories, size classes, egg types, activity rhythms) were estimated and tested for significance using permutations. Permutations can be performed in different ways, corresponding to different ecological hypotheses. Results were compared to predictions made independently by reef fish ecologists, in order to assess the method as well as the pertinence of the variables subjected to the analysis. The new method is shown to be applicable to a wide class of ecological problems.},

  abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

  abstract = {The loss of biodiversity is thought to have adverse effects on multiple ecosystem functions, including the decline of community stability. Decreased diversity reduces the strength of the portfolio effect, a mechanism stabilizing community temporal fluctuations. Community stability is also expected to decrease with greater variability in individual species populations and with synchrony of their fluctuations. In semi-natural meadows, eutrophication is one of the most important drivers of diversity decline; it is expected to increase species fluctuations and synchrony among them, all effects leading to lower community stability. With a 16 year time series of biomass data from a temperate species-rich meadow with fertilization and removal of the dominant species, we assessed population biomass temporal (co)variation under different management types and competition intensity, and in relation to species functional traits and to species diversity. Whereas the effect of dominant removal was relatively small (with a tendency towards lower stability), fertilization markedly decreased community stability (i.e. increased coefficient of variation in the total biomass) and species diversity. On average, the fluctuations of individual populations were mutually independent, with a slight tendency towards synchrony in unfertilized plots, and a tendency towards compensatory dynamics in fertilized plots and no effects of removal. The marked decrease of synchrony with fertilization, contrary to the majority of the results reported previously, follows the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Synchrony increased also with species functional similarity stressing the importance of shared ecological strategies in driving similar species responses to weather fluctuations. As expected, the decrease of temporal stability of total biomass was mainly related to the decrease of species richness, with its effect remaining significant also after accounting for fertilization. The weakening of the portfolio effect with species richness decline is a crucial driver of community destabilization. However, the positive effect of species richness on temporal stability of total biomass was not due to increased compensatory dynamics, since synchrony increased with species richness. This shows that the negative effect of eutrophication on community stability does not operate through increasing synchrony, but through the reduction of diversity.

Unfortunately, observable patterns provide only a proportion of the information necessary for fully understanding the mechanisms and processes acting on a particular population or community. We suggest conservation managers use the often overlooked information relative to species absences and pay particular attention to dark diversity (i.e., a set of species that are absent from a site but that could disperse to and establish there, in other words, the absent portion of a habitat-specific species pool). Together with existing ecological metrics, concepts, and conservation tools, dark diversity can be used to complement and further develop conservation prioritization and management decisions through an understanding of biodiversity relativized by its potential (i.e., its species pool). Furthermore, through a detailed understanding of the population, community, and functional dark diversity, the restoration potential of degraded habitats can be more rigorously assessed and so to the likelihood of successful species invasions. We suggest the application of the dark diversity concept is currently an underappreciated source of information that is valuable for conservation applications ranging from macroscale conservation prioritization to more locally scaled restoration ecology and the management of invasive species.},

Here we use a recently developed 21-year (1988-2008) record of satellite based vegetation optical depth (VOD, a proxy for vegetation water content and aboveground biomass), to show that nearly all steppe grasslands in Mongolia experienced significant decreases in VOD. Approximately 60\% of the VOD declines can be directly explained by variations in rainfall and surface temperature. After removing these climate induced influences, a significant decreasing trend still persists in the VOD residuals across regions of Mongolia. Correlations in spatial patterns and temporal trends suggest that a marked increase in goat density with associated grazing pressures and wild fires are the most likely non-climatic factors behind grassland degradation.},

  abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution.},

  abstract = {In many regions worldwide, cropland abandonment is growing, which has strong and known environmental and socio-economic consequences. Yet, spatially explicit information on the spatial pattern of abandonment is sparse, particularly in post-Soviet countries of Central Asia. When thriving reaching for key Millennium Development Goals such as food security and poverty reduction, the issue of cropland abandonment is critical and therefore must be monitored and limited, or land use transformed into an alternative one. Central Asia experienced large changes of its agricultural system after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Land degradation, which started already before independence, and cropland abandonment is growing in extent, but their spatial pattern remains ill-understood. The objective of this study was to map and analyse agricultural land use in the irrigated areas of Kyzyl-Orda, southern Kazakhstan, Central Asia. For mapping land use and identifying abandoned agricultural land, an objectbased classification approach was applied. Random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms permitted classifying Landsat and RapidEye data from 2009 to 2014. Overlaying these maps with information about irrigated land parcels, installed during the Soviet period, allowed indicating abandoned fields. Fusing the results of the two approaches, RF and SVM, resulted in classification accuracies of up to 97\%. This was statistically significantly higher than with RF or SVM alone. Through the analysis of the land use trajectories, abandoned agricultural fields and a clear indication of abandoned land were identified on almost 50\% of all fields in Kyzyl-Orda with an accuracy of approximately 80\%. The outputs of this study may provide valuable information for planners, policy- and decision-makers to support better-informed decision-making like reducing possible environmental impacts of land abandonment, or identifying areas for sustainable intensification or re-cultivation.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that wild and domestic herbivores have modified the structure and composition of arid and semi-arid plant communities of western North America, but these beliefs have rarely been tested in long-term, well-replicated studies. We examined the effects of removing large herbivores from semi-arid shrublands for 40-50 years using 17 fenced exclosures in western Colorado, USA. Shrub cover was greater (F=5.87, P=0.0020) and cover (F=3.01, P=0.0601) and frequency (F=3.89, P=0.0211) of forbs was less inside the exclosures (protected) relative to grazed plots. However, we found no significant effects (minimum P=0.18) of protection from grazing on cover or frequency of grasses, biotic crusts, or bare soil. Although mean species richness and diversity were similar between treatments, protected areas had much higher dominance by fewer species, primarily sagebrush. Exclusion of herbivores changed the relationship between species richness and evenness. Consistent with theoretical expectations, species evenness was positively correlated with richness in protected plots (r2=0.54). However, contrary to theory, evenness and richness were inversely related in grazed plots (r2adjacent=0.72, r2distant=0.84). We suggest that these differences resulted because grazing acts as a stressor promoting facilitative relationships between plant species that might compete for resources in the absence of grazing. We conclude that exclusion of grazing in the sites we studied caused minor changes in cover and diversity of herbaceous plants, but caused a clear increase in the cover of shrubs. Importantly, the exclusion of ungulates changed the relationship between evenness and richness.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research grew rapidly following concerns that biodiversity loss would negatively affect ecosystem functions and the ecosystem services they underpin. However, despite evidence that biodiversity strongly affects ecosystem functioning, the influence of BEF research upon policy and the management of `real-world' ecosystems, i.e., semi-natural habitats and agroecosystems, has been limited. Here, we address this issue by classifying BEF research into three clusters based on the degree of human control over species composition and the spatial scale, in terms of grain, of the study, and discussing how the research of each cluster is best suited to inform particular fields of ecosystem management. Research in the first cluster, small-grain highly controlled studies, is best able to provide general insights into mechanisms and to inform the management of species-poor and highly managed systems such as croplands, plantations, and the restoration of heavily degraded ecosystems. Research from the second cluster, small-grain observational studies, and species removal and addition studies, may allow for direct predictions of the impacts of species loss in specific semi-natural ecosystems. Research in the third cluster, large-grain uncontrolled studies, may best inform landscape-scale management and national-scale policy. We discuss barriers to transfer within each cluster and suggest how new research and knowledge exchange mechanisms may overcome these challenges. To meet the potential for BEF research to address global challenges, we recommend transdisciplinary research that goes beyond these current clusters and considers the social-ecological context of the ecosystems in which BEF knowledge is generated. This requires recognizing the social and economic value of biodiversity for ecosystem services at scales, and in units, that matter to land managers and policy makers.},

We invaded disturbed and undisturbed subplots in and out of rodent exclosures with seeds of native or exotic species in grasslands in Montana, California and Germany. Seed addition enhanced aboveground biomass and species richness compared with no-seeds-added controls, with exotics having disproportionate effects on productivity compared with natives. Disturbance enhanced the effects of seed addition on productivity and species richness, whereas rodents reduced productivity, but only in Germany and California. Our results demonstrate that experimental introduction of novel species can alter ecosystem function and community structure, but that local filters such as competition and herbivory influence the magnitude of these impacts.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is an important factor in plant community assembly, but assembly studies seldom include information on actual dispersal into communities, i.e. the local propagule pool. The aim of this study was to determine which factors influence plant community assembly by focusing on two phases of the assembly process: the dispersal phase and the establishment phase. At 12 study sites in grazed ex-arable fields in Sweden the local plant community was determined and in a 100-m radius around the centre of each site, the regional species pool was measured. The local seed bank and the seed rain was explored to estimate the local propagule pool. Trait-based models were then applied to investigate if species traits (height, seed mass, clonal abilities, specific leaf area and dispersal method) and regional abundance influenced which species from the regional species pool, dispersed to the local community (dispersal phase) and which established (establishment phase). Filtering of species during the dispersal phase indicates the effect of seed limitation while filtering during the establishment phase indicates microsite limitation. On average 36\% of the regional species pool dispersed to the local sites and of those 78\% did establish. Species with enhanced dispersal abilities, e.g. higher regional abundance, smaller seeds and dispersed by cattle, were more likely to disperse to the sites than other species. At half the sites, dispersal was influenced by species height. Species establishment was however mainly unlinked to the traits included in this study. This study underlines the importance of seed limitation in local plant community assembly. It also suggests that without information on species dispersal into a site, it is difficult to distinguish between the influence of dispersal and establishment abilities, and thus seed and microsite limitation, as both can be linked to the same trait.},

  abstract = {The Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP) is an integrated long-term study that evaluates ecological effects of alternative treatments designed to reduce woody fuels and to stimulate the herbaceous understory of sagebrush steppe communities of the Intermountain West. This synopsis summarizes results through 3 yr posttreatment. Woody vegetation reduction by prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, or herbicides initiated a cascade of effects, beginning with increased availability of nitrogen and soil water, followed by increased growth of herbaceous vegetation. Response of butterflies and magnitudes of runoff and erosion closely followed herbaceous vegetation recovery. Effects on shrubs, biological soil crust, tree cover, surface woody fuel loads, and sagebrush-obligate bird communities will take longer to be fully expressed. In the short term, cool wet sites were more resilient than warm dry sites, and resistance was mostly dependent on pretreatment herbaceous cover. At least 10 yr of posttreatment time will likely be necessary to determine outcomes for most sites. Mechanical treatments did not serve as surrogates for prescribed fire in how each influenced the fuel bed, the soil, erosion, and sage-obligate bird communities. Woody vegetation reduction by any means resulted in increased availability of soil water, higher herbaceous cover, and greater butterfly numbers. We identified several trade-offs (desirable outcomes for some variables, undesirable for others), involving most components of the study system. Trade-offs are inevitable when managing complex natural systems, and they underline the importance of asking questions about the whole system when developing management objectives. Substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sagebrush steppe ecosystems emphasizes the point that there will rarely be a ``recipe'' for choosing management actions on any specific area. Use of a consistent evaluation process linked to monitoring may be the best chance managers have for arresting woodland expansion and cheatgrass invasion that may accelerate in a future warming climate.},

  abstract = {The first full greenhouse gas (GHG) flux budget of an intensively managed grassland in Switzerland (Chamau) is presented. The three major trace gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. For CO2 concentrations, an open-path infrared gas analyzer was used, while N2O and CH4 concentrations were measured with a recently developed continuous-wave quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCLAS). We investigated the magnitude of these trace gas emissions after grassland restoration, including ploughing, harrowing, sowing, and fertilization with inorganic and organic fertilizers in 2012. Large peaks of N2O fluxes (20-50 nmol m(-2) s(-1) compared with a {$<$}5 nmol m(-2) s(-1) background) were observed during thawing of the soil after the winter period and after mineral fertilizer application followed by re-sowing in the beginning of the summer season. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were controlled by nitrogen input, plant productivity, soil water content and temperature. Management activities led to increased variations of N2O fluxes up to 14 days after the management event as compared with background fluxes measured during periods without management ({$<$}5 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Fluxes of CO2 remained small until full plant development in early summer 2012. In contrast, methane emissions showed only minor variations over time. The annual GHG flux budget was dominated by N2O (48\% contribution) and CO2 emissions (44\%). CH4 flux contribution to the annual budget was only minor (8\%). We conclude that recently developed multi-species QCLAS in an EC system open new opportunities to determine the temporal variation of N2O and CH4 fluxes, which further allow to quantify annual emissions. With respect to grassland restoration, our study emphasizes the key role of N2O and CO2 losses after ploughing, changing a permanent grassland from a carbon sink to a significant carbon source.},

The steppes taken under culture in the 1950s in  the districts of Novosibirsk and Altai were protected around 1968 by a high number of  hedges. Following the economic decline of Siberian agriculture, the risk of recurrence of  active morphological and other unwanted processes grows, which constitutes an early stage  of desertification. In this study, special emphasis has been taken on the description of the  desertification indicators and land use basics in the Kulunda Steppe, through the example  of a detailed pedological investigation of the farm Ivanovskoe (ca. 20,000 ha) near Bagan  in the northern Kulunda Steppe. Desertification is analysed and evaluated in detail,  especially by the proportion of rough material on agriculturally used Chernozem which  has increased significantly since cultivation. Deflation damage is still proven on most of  these soils. The saline lakes in the area are already drying up slowly. The river Bagan  carries much less water than before steppe cultivation.},

Here, we demonstrate that ecosystem multifunctionality, based on 82 indicator variables of ecosystem functions in a grassland biodiversity experiment, increases strongly with increasing biodiversity. Analysing subsets of functions showed that the effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality were stronger when more functions were included and that the strength of the biodiversity effects depended on the identity of the functions included. Limits to multifunctionality arose from negative correlations among functions and functions that were not correlated with biodiversity. Our findings underline that the management of ecosystems for the protection of biodiversity cannot be replaced by managing~for particular ecosystem functions or services and emphasize the need for specific management to protect biodiversity. More plant~species from the experimental pool of 60 species contributed to functioning when more functions were considered. An individual contribution to multifunctionality could be demonstrated for only a fraction of the species.},

  abstract = {Species loss due to an increasing number of added nutrients has been explained by both light competition through biomass increase and by niche dimension reduction as a result of species specific limiting soil resources trade-offs. Disturbances, by reducing community biomass, species dominance and increasing light availability, may counteract above ground nutrient effects. However, it is unknown if diversity loss at local or spatial scales generated by increasing number of added nutrients can be redressed with canopy disturbance. We evaluated if local (alpha) and spatial scale (beta) diversity loss generated by the number of added nutrients can be reverted by disturbances in Flooding Pampa grasslands, Argentina. In a 4-yr replicated field experiment, we added soil resources combining nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to obtain 0, 1, 2 or 3 nutrients and manipulated the regime of canopy disturbance by seasonal mowing and biomass removal. We found that the increasing number of added nutrients strongly reduced local and spatial plant diversity, despite biomass and light changes generated by mowing. In mown plots, nutrient driven local diversity loss was intensified along time, thus increasing species dominance. While mowing did not affect dominant species loss, increasing number of added nutrients promoted rare species loss and reduced spatial dissimilarity. Furthermore, mowing increased local and spatial diversity regardless light or biomass effects, suggesting alternative pathway effects for disturbance. Synthesis: Our results demonstrated that even when disturbance generated a positive effect on local and spatial diversity, it did not completely counteract the negative effect of number of added nutrients. Thus, the relative importance of above and belowground resource competition may change when chronic disturbances alter community dominance. Under low light availability, above ground competition may drive species richness loss but when disturbance reduces light limitation, the increasing number of added nutrients may reduce niche dimensionality and thus species coexistence. In sum, faced with the need to manage eutrophized grasslands, our study showed that disturbance may not completely mitigate the negative effect of multiple nutrient inputs on local and spatial grassland diversity.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems.},

In a 13-year grassland experiment, we evaluated how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ), N fertilization, and plant species richness alter soil N cycling. We focused on soil inorganic N pools, including ammonium and nitrate, and two N fluxes, net N mineralization and net nitrification. In contrast with existing hypotheses, such as progressive N limitation, and with observations from other, often shorter, studies, elevated CO2 had relatively static and small, or insignificant, effects on soil inorganic N pools and fluxes. Nitrogen fertilization had inconsistent effects on soil N transformations, but increased soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Plant species richness had increasingly positive effects on soil N transformations over time, likely because in diverse subplots the concentrations of N in roots increased over time. Species richness also had increasingly positive effects on concentrations of ammonium in soil, perhaps because more carbon accumulated in soils of diverse subplots, providing exchange sites for ammonium. By contrast, subplots planted with 16 species had lower soil nitrate concentrations than less diverse subplots, especially when fertilized, probably due to greater N uptake capacity of subplots with 16 species. Monocultures of different plant functional types had distinct effects on N transformations and nitrate concentrations, such that not all monocultures differed from diverse subplots in the same manner. The first few years of data would not have adequately forecast the effects of N fertilization and diversity on soil N cycling in later years; therefore, the dearth of long-term manipulations of plant species richness and N inputs is a hindrance to forecasting the state of the soil N cycle and ecosystem functions in extant plant communities.},

The terminology used to describe these limitations is, however, very inconsistent. Since the different terms often appear in conclusions of the papers, the inconsistency in their use obscures the message of these papers. In this study, we review the current uses of these terms, identify the basic concepts involved in the discussion of a limitation and link the concepts with the currently used terms. Finally, we discuss the experimental approaches used to assess the different types of limitations. We differentiated four basic concepts resulting from the combination of limitation by environment versus ability to grow and spread, and two spatial scales (local and regional scale). The two concepts at each spatial scale are expected to form a gradient of all possible combinations of the two respective types of limitations. In the considerations of various experimental approaches used to assess these limitations, we conclude that sowing experiments, i.e. seed addition into existing populations or seed introduction into unoccupied habitats, are the only reliable types of evidence for the different types of limitations.},

We tested these predictions by conducting a meta-analysis of 28 studies encompassing 62 experiments examining effects of propagule supply (seed arrival) on plant species richness under contrasting intensities of ecological filters (owing to disturbance and resource availability). Seed arrival increased local species richness in a wide range of communities (forest, grassland, montane, savanna, wetland), resulting in a positive mean effect size across experiments. Mean effect size was 70\% higher in disturbed relative to undisturbed communities, suggesting that disturbance increases recruitment opportunities for immigrating species. In contrast, effect size was not significantly influenced by nutrient or water availability. Among seed-addition experiments, effect size was positively correlated with species and functional diversity within the pool of added seeds (species evenness and seed-size diversity), primarily in disturbed communities. Our analysis provides experimental support for the general hypothesis that species pools and local environmental heterogeneity interactively structure plant communities. We highlight empirical gaps that can be addressed by future experiments and discuss implications for community assembly, species coexistence, and the maintenance of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Ecological disturbances are often hypothesized to alter community assembly processes that influence variation in community composition ({$\beta$}-diversity). Disturbance can cause convergence in community composition (low {$\beta$}-diversity) by increasing niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Alternatively, disturbance can cause divergence in community composition (high {$\beta$}-diversity) by increasing habitat filtering across environmental gradients. However, because disturbance may also influence {$\beta$}-diversity through random sampling effects owing to changes in the number of individuals in local communities (community size) or abundances in the regional species pool, observed patterns of {$\beta$}-diversity alone cannot be used to unambiguously discern the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. We compared {$\beta$}-diversity of woody plants and inferred assembly mechanisms among unburned forests and forests managed with prescribed fires in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. Using a null-model approach, we compared how environmental gradients influenced {$\beta$}-diversity after controlling for differences in local community size and regional species abundances between unburned and burned landscapes. Observed {$\beta$}-diversity was higher in burned landscapes. However, this pattern disappeared or reversed after controlling for smaller community size in burned landscapes. {$\beta$}-diversity was higher than expected by chance in both landscapes, indicating an important role for processes that create clumped species distributions. Moreover, fire appeared to decrease clumping of species at broader spatial scales, suggesting homogenization of community composition through niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Environmental variables, however, explained similar amounts of variation in {$\beta$}-diversity in both landscapes, suggesting that disturbance did not alter the relative importance of habitat filtering. Our results indicate that contingent responses of communities to fire reflect a combination of fire-induced changes in local community size and scale-dependent effects of fire on species clumping across landscapes. Synthesis. Although niche-based mechanisms of community assembly are often invoked to explain changes in community composition following disturbance, our results suggest that these changes also arise through random sampling effects owing to the influence of disturbance on community size. Comparative studies of these processes across disturbed ecosystems will provide important insights into the ecological conditions that determine when disturbance alters the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in natural and human-modified landscapes.},

We estimate that land use and related pressures have already reduced local biodiversity intactness--the average proportion of natural biodiversity remaining in local ecosystems--beyond its recently proposed planetary boundary across 58.1\% of the world's land surface, where 71.4\% of the human population live. Biodiversity intactness within most biomes (especially grassland biomes), most biodiversity hotspots, and even some wilderness areas is inferred to be beyond the boundary. Such widespread transgression of safe limits suggests that biodiversity loss, if unchecked, will undermine efforts toward long-term sustainable development.},

We highlight the benefits of recognizing two distinct components of change in an ecological unit (i.e., ecosystem, community, population): 'resistance', the ability to withstand disturbance; and 'resilience', the capacity to recover following disturbance. By adopting a 'resistance-resilience' framework, important insights for conservation can be gained into: (i) the key role of resistance in response to persistent disturbance, (ii) the intrinsic attributes of an ecological unit associated with resistance and resilience, (iii) the extrinsic environmental factors that influence resistance and resilience, (iv) mechanisms that confer resistance and resilience, (v) the post-disturbance status of an ecological unit, (vi) the nature of long-term ecological changes, and (vii) policy-relevant ways of communicating the ecological impacts of disturbance processes.},

  abstract = {One reason restoration often fails is a lack of native plant establishment. Establishment failure can occur due to a lack of dispersal into the site, inappropriate abiotic conditions for plant survival, or biotic interactions that reduce germination rates or seedling survival. Understanding what is limiting establishment is critical for restoration success. Unfortunately, there has been little synthetic work to identify which restoration practices (e.g., direct seeding, weeding, irrigation) are most likely to improve plant establishment. Here we used a meta-analytical approach to determine what practices are most likely to enhance establishment success in grassland communities in California. We explored the impact of these practices on whole communities as well as on different functional groups (grass and forb). We categorized techniques by the constraint they addressed (dispersal, abiotic, or biotic) to determine which restoration practices are more likely to improve plant establishment. We found that addressing the dispersal filter is the best way to improve plant establishment regardless of the functional group. This suggests that most native plants targeted in restoration are seed limited. While we were able to identify restoration techniques that improve plant establishment, our synthesis revealed that there were insufficient numbers of studies and a lack of uniformity between treatments that hampered efforts to make broad conclusions. If we can expand research to more ecosystems, and use standardized treatments within each ecosystem, the restoration community could synthesize research more efficiently, which would inform our ultimate goal of increasing the success of restoration.

Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their 'resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.},

However, we have little understanding of whether the impacts of plant traits on soil systems are modified by other management practices, such as fertiliser use. We tested whether relationships among plant traits, soil biota (microbes and nematodes) and soil functions (carbon and nitrogen (N) cycling) change with N fertiliser regime in a field-based, intensively managed experiment with high biomass removal. The experiment consisted of seven plant species compositions crossed with six N fertiliser rates (0\textendash 500 kg N ha-1 year-1). Relationships among plant traits, soil biota and soil functions were often consistent across N fertiliser rates. However, the relationship of percentage N2 fixer to qCO2 shifted from negative to neutral as N rates increased, and the slope of several relationships of plant traits to N cycling indicators declined when {$>$}200 kg N ha-1 year-1 was added. The negative relationship of the fungal: bacterial ratio to N cycling indicators also became neutral when {$>$} 200 kg N ha-1 year-1 was added, and the relationships of bacterivore abundance and the plant parasitic index to respiration changed direction as N inputs increased. Some relationships of plant traits and soil biota to soil functions were in unexpected directions. This was sometimes associated with species-specific effects and inconsistent trait trade-offs within species. In general, conservative plant traits and fungal dominance were associated with low N cycling and cellulose paper decomposition rates, but high respiration rates. Nematode-based variables were better predictors of some functions than microbial ones; their incorporation into plant trait research could improve predictive power and system understanding. Synthesis and applications. Manipulating plant community traits can modify soil functions in intensively managed systems, but may result in larger changes where fertiliser nitrogen inputs are relatively low. Improved modelling that integrates how plant community traits, species-specific effects and management practices interact to determine soil functions will be required before managers can confidently predict the consequences of changing plant community traits.},

  abstract = {The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that scholars can make simple, predictive models of social-ecological systems (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear, cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested, multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses of how attributes of (i) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing area), (ii) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish, water, fodder), (iii) the users of that system, and (iv) the governance system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones. The framework is intended to be a step toward building a strong interdisciplinary science of complex, multilevel systems that will enable future diagnosticians to match governance arrangements to specific problems embedded in a social-ecological context.},

Studies examining the outcomes of old field restoration predominantly focus on plant, and sometimes, vertebrate communities. Fewer studies have systematically investigated the effects of restoration efforts on soil properties or ground-dwelling invertebrates and there is limited synthesis of these data. We conducted a global meta-analysis of published studies to assess the effects of old field restoration on soil properties and soil invertebrate abundance and richness. We anticipated increased vegetation cover would improve soil properties towards reference condition and in turn, this would promote invertebrate abundance and richness. Studies were included if field sites had a history of cropping or livestock grazing. We identified 42 studies (1994\textendash 2019) from 16 countries that met our criteria. More studies assessed passive restoration methods than active planting, and native species were more commonly planted than exotic species. Results showed that restoration improved soil conditions with respect to total nitrogen, magnesium, soil carbon, bulk density and porosity when compared to controls, however conditions similar to those in reference ecosystems were generally not achieved, even 50+ years after restoration had been initiated. Moderator analyses showed few significant tends, however bulk density improved with age, and in passively restored versus reference ecosystems. Outcomes for soil carbon and bulk density were most predominant in the top soil when compared to the degraded ecosystem. We detected no consistent trends for the effect of restoration on soil invertebrate richness and abundance compared to the control or reference ecosystems. Synthesis and applications. Our global meta-analysis found strong evidence that old field restoration in agricultural landscapes had positive effects on soil condition but did not lead to full recovery when compared to a reference ecosystem. We detected few and idiosyncratic effects for invertebrates. Further research is needed to understand effects of restoration on soil invertebrate functional groups and to develop management interventions that accelerate the restoration of soil condition.},

  abstract = {Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon cycle and climate. However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity. Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent ({$\pm$}13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent ({$\pm$}16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.},

  abstract = {With the increased occurrence of climate extremes, there is an urgent need to better understand how management strategies affect the capacity of the soil microbial community to maintain its ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient cycling). To address this issue, intact monoliths were extracted from conventional and ecological managed grasslands in three countries across Europe and exposed under common air condition (temperature and moisture) to one of three altered rain regimes (dry, wet and intermittent wet/dry) as compared to a normal regime. Subsequently, we compared the resistance and recovery of the soil microbial biomass, potential enzyme activities and community composition. The microbial community composition differed with soil management and rain regimes. Soil microbial biomass increased from the wetter to the dryer rain regime, paralleling an increase of available carbon and nutrients, suggesting low sensitivity to soil moisture reduction but nutritional limitations of soil microbes. Conversely, enzyme activities decreased with all altered rain regimes. Resistance and recovery (considering absolute distance between normal and altered rain regime) of the microbial communities depended on soil management. Conventional-intensive management showed higher resistance of two fundamental properties for nutrient cycling (i.e. bacterial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities) yet associated with more important changes in microbial community composition. This suggests an internal community reorganization promoting biomass and activity resistance. Conversely, under ecological management bacterial biomass and enzyme activities showed better recovery capacity, whereas no or very low recovery of these properties was observed under conventional management. These management effects were consistent across the three altered rain regimes investigated, indicating common factors controlling microbial communities' response to different climate-related stresses. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides experimental evidence for an important trade-off for agroecosystem management between (a) stabilizing nutrient cycling potential during an altered rain regime period at the expense of very low recovery capacity and potential long-term effect (conventional sites) and (b) promoting the capacity of the microbial community to recover its functional potential after the end of the stress (ecological sites). Thus, management based on ecologically sound principles may be the best option to sustain long-term soil functioning under climate change.},

  abstract = {Late Pleistocene extinctions are of interest to paleontological and anthropological research. In North America and Australia, human occupation occurred during a short period of time and overexploitation may have led to the extinction of mammalian megafauna. In northern Eurasia megafaunal extinctions are believed to have occurred over a relatively longer period of time, perhaps as a result of changing environmental conditions, but the picture is much less clear. To consider megafaunal extinction in Eurasia, we compare differences in the geographical distribution and commonness of extinct and extant species between paleontological and archaeological localities from the late middle Pleistocene to Holocene. Purely paleontological localities, as well as most extinct species, were distributed north of archaeological sites and of the extant species, suggesting that apart from possible differences in adaptations between humans and other species, humans could also have a detrimental effect on large mammal distribution. However, evidence for human overexploitation applies only to the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus. Other human-preferred species survive into the Holocene, including Rangifer tarandus, Equus ferus, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus, Equus hemionus, Saiga tatarica, and Sus scrofa. Mammuthus primigenius and Megaloceros giganteus were rare in archaeological sites. Carnivores appear little influenced by human presence, although they become rarer in Holocene archaeological sites. Overall, the data are consistent with the conclusion that humans acted as efficient hunters selecting for the most abundant species. Our study supports the idea that the late Pleistocene extinctions were environmentally driven by climatic changes that triggered habitat fragmentation, species range reduction, and population decrease, after which human interference either by direct hunting or via indirect activities probably became critical.},

  abstract = {Agricultural intensification is a leading cause of global biodiversity loss, especially for threatened and near-threatened species. One widely implemented response is 'wildlife-friendly farming', involving the close integration of conservation and extensive farming practices within agricultural landscapes. However, the putative benefits from this controversial policy are currently either unknown or thought unlikely to extend to rare and declining species. Here, we show that new, evidence-based approaches to habitat creation on intensively managed farmland in England can achieve large increases in plant, bee and bird species. In particular, we found that habitat enhancement methods designed to provide the requirements of sensitive target biota consistently increased the richness and abundance of both rare and common species, with 10-fold to greater than 100-fold more rare species per sample area than generalized conventional conservation measures. Furthermore, targeting landscapes of high species richness amplified beneficial effects on the least mobile taxa: plants and bees. Our results provide the first unequivocal support for a national wildlife-friendly farming policy and suggest that this approach should be implemented much more extensively to address global biodiversity loss. However, to be effective, these conservation measures must be evidence-based, and developed using sound knowledge of the ecological requirements of key species.},

The potential for such changes is growing due to anthropogenic pressures, which challenges the resilience of societies and ecosystems. Abrupt ecological changes are difficult to diagnose because they can arise from a variety of circumstances, including rapid changes in external drivers (e.g., climate, or resource extraction), nonlinear responses to gradual changes in drivers, and interactions among multiple drivers and disturbances. We synthesize strategies for identifying causes of abrupt ecological change and highlight instances where abrupt changes are likely. Diagnosing abrupt changes and inferring causation are increasingly important as society seek to adapt to rapid, multifaceted environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water \textendash{} the third key resource \textendash stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up \textendash{} fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. Synthesis. Traits matter. A single `fast\textendash slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Successful restoration of semi-natural grasslands on grasslands previously subject to intensive management needs to overcome manifold barriers. These include high soil fertility, the dominance of a few fast-growing plant species, degraded soil faunal communities and missing propagules of the targeted above- and below-ground flora and fauna. A combination of removing the topsoil and introducing propagules of target plants has become one of the major tools for nature conservation agencies and practitioners to reduce soil fertility and restore former species-rich grasslands in various European countries. Using topsoil removal as a restoration measure has provoked an ongoing debate between supporting nature conservation and rejecting soil protection agencies. Although it favours species-rich plant communities, it strongly disturbs soil communities and affects physical and chemical soil properties and processes. Currently, there is a lack of long-term data to assess how restored grassland ecosystems develop and recover after topsoil removal. Here, we used two well-established bioindicators, soil nematodes and plants, to quantify restoration success of topsoil removal in comparison with alternative restoration measures and target communities 22 years after intervention. The nematode community composition indicated reduced nutrient availability in the restored systems, as was aimed at by topsoil removal. Nevertheless, after this 22-year period following topsoil removal, nematode composition and structure revealed successful recovery. Plant communities benefitted from the reduction of soil nutrients after topsoil removal as indicated by higher numbers of plant species and higher Shannon diversity. Furthermore, topsoil removal strongly promoted the re-establishment of plant species of the target plant community. Synthesis and applications. Overall, our study demonstrates how a massive intervention by topsoil removal proved successful in converting intensively managed into species-rich grasslands. This contrasts with the mild intervention of repeated mowing and removing of the harvested plant material. We show that, in the long run, potential negative effects of topsoil removal on the soil fauna can be successfully overcome and plant communities can develop into targeted species-rich grassland.},

  abstract = {The rangelands of Kazakhstan were historically used for nomadic pastoralism, with long migrations to make best use of the seasonal availability of pasture. In Soviet times, livestock production was intensified. From the 1970s concerns were raised in the Soviet literature about rangeland degradation, but very little was written about Kazakhstan's rangelands in the Western literature. Rangeland science in the Soviet system uses rather different methodologies to those in the West; this needs to be taken into account when comparing the two literatures. Here we use literature reviews, fieldwork and modelling to assess the likelihood that Kazakhstan's rangelands were overgrazed in Soviet times. We conclude that the extent of degradation of the pastures in our case study areas was probably lower than suggested in the literature, but that seasonal stock movement was essential to avoid degradation. Since independence, stock numbers have collapsed and stock movements are now limited. Recent field assessments suggest that the rangelands are in good condition. Kazakhstan's rangelands present a rare opportunity for the study of rangeland dynamics under dramatically changing stock numbers.},

  abstract = {The focus of a new experiment, set up in Jena in spring 2002, are the effects of biodiversity on element cycles and the interaction of plant diversity with herbivores and soil fauna. The experimental design explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and testing for the effects of particular functional groups differ from previous experiments. Based on a species pool of 60 plant species common to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16 (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established on 90 plots (20 m \texttimes{} 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3.5 m \texttimes{} 3.5 m) were set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the variability in ecosystem responses. In a dominance experiment, the effects of interactions among nine selected highly productive species are studied. Each species is grown as monoculture replicated once. Effekte der Biodiversit\"at auf Elementkreisl\"aufe und Wechselwirkungen der pflanzlichen Artenvielfalt mit Bodenfauna und Herbivoren stehen im Mitttelpunkt eines neuen Experiments, das im Fr\"uhjahr 2002 in Jena eingerichtet wurde. Das Versuchsdesign ber\"ucksichtigt ausdr\"ucklich die Kritik, die an den Aufbau fr\"uherer Biodiversit\"atsversuche gerichtet wurde. Die Auswahl funktioneller Gruppen von Pflanzenarten, die statistischen M\"oglichkeiten, die Effekte des ``Sampling'' gegen Komplementarit\"at zu trennen sowie den Einflu\ss{} funktioneller Gruppen zu \"uberpr\"ufen, unterscheiden dieses Experiment von fr\"uheren Versuchen. Sechzig typische Pflanzenarten der zentraleurop\"aischen Frischwiesen (Arrhenatherion) bilden den Artenpool f\"ur den Versuch. Auf 90 Fl\"achen wurden Artenmischungen etabliert, die 1 bis 16 (60) Arten und 1 bis 4 funktionelle Gruppen dieser Pflanzenarten enthalten. Die Versuchsparzellen haben eine Gr\"o\ss e von 20 m \texttimes{} 20 m, auf denen in genesteter Anordnung verschiedene Teilexperimente durchgef\"uhrt werden. Zus\"atzlich wurden 390 kleine Parzellen (3.5 m \texttimes{} 3.5 m) angelegt, um spezifische Hypothesen zu \"uberpr\"ufen. Alle Arten werden hier mit je einer Wiederholung als Monokulturen kultiviert. Identische Wiederholungen aller Artenmischungen sollen deren Variabilit\"at untersuchen. In einem Dominanz-Versuch werden die Effekte der Wechselwirkungen zwischen 9 ausgew\"ahlten hochproduktiven Arten untersucht.},

  abstract = {Intensive longitudinal research designs are increasingly used to study personality processes.  The resulting data can be highly informative in ways that other data cannot, but these data also pose statistical challenges.  Most often a multilevel or mixed effects modeling approach is adopted which is appropriate but may not be optimal.  Surprisingly little attention is given to reliability of measurement, and the models often lack adequate complexity to test theoretical questions of interest.  These limitations can be addressed with multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM), which weds the ability to deal with nested data structures with the strengths of structural equation modeling (e.g., latent variable models, multiple outcomes and mediators).  This article provides a gentle introduction to MSEM for personality researchers.  Following an initial review of the relevant challenges facing researchers interested in studying personality using intensive longitudinal data, basic issues in MSEM are summarized, and a series of example models are presented.  The online supplementary material provides Mplus syntax for the models presented.},

We address this controversy by assessing, over 1 year, plant diversity effects on biomass yield, forage quality (i.e. nutritive values), quality-adjusted yield (biomass yield\,\texttimes\,forage quality), and revenues across different management intensities (extensive to intensive) on subplots of a large-scale grassland biodiversity experiment. Plant diversity substantially increased quality-adjusted yield and revenues. These findings hold for a wide range of management intensities, i.e., fertilization levels and cutting frequencies, in semi-natural grasslands. Plant diversity was an important production factor independent of management intensity, as it enhanced quality-adjusted yield and revenues similarly to increasing fertilization and cutting frequency. Consequently, maintaining and reestablishing plant diversity could be a way to sustainably manage temperate grasslands.},

  abstract = {Large proportions of the Earth's land surface are covered by biomes dominated by C(4) grasses. These C(4)-dominated biomes originated during the late Miocene, 3-8 million years ago (Ma), but there is evidence that C(4) grasses evolved some 20 Ma earlier during the early Miocene/Oligocene. Explanations for this lag between evolution and expansion invoke changes in atmospheric CO(2), seasonality of climate and fire. However, there is still no consensus about which of these factors triggered C(4) grassland expansion. We use a vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM), to test how CO(2), temperature, precipitation, fire and the tolerance of vegetation to fire influence C(4) grassland expansion. Simulations are forced with late Miocene climates generated with the Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere-vegetation general circulation model. We show that physiological differences between the C(3) and C(4) photosynthetic pathways cannot explain C(4) grass invasion into forests, but that fire is a crucial driver. Fire-promoting plant traits serve to expand the climate space in which C(4)-dominated biomes can persist. We propose that three mechanisms were involved in C(4) expansion: the physiological advantage of C(4) grasses under low atmospheric CO(2) allowed them to invade C(3) grasslands; fire allowed grasses to invade forests; and the evolution of fire-resistant savanna trees expanded the climate space that savannas can invade.},

  abstract = {The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire-prone in recent decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following years of high rainfall. Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post-fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life-history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life-history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire-response. Six life-history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long-term (up to 52 years) post-fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life-history traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind-dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non-wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life-history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant, long-lived species of this region possess a combination of traits limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to favor alternative life-history strategies.},

  abstract = {Tropical grasses fuel the majority of fires on Earth. In fire-prone landscapes, enhanced flammability may be adaptive for grasses via the maintenance of an open canopy and an increase in spatiotemporal opportunities for recruitment and regeneration. In addition, by burning intensely but briefly, high flammability may protect resprouting buds from lethal temperatures. Despite these potential benefits of high flammability to fire-prone grasses, variation in flammability among grass species, and how trait differences underpin this variation, remains unknown.By burning leaves and plant parts, we experimentally determined how five plant traits (biomass quantity, biomass density, biomass moisture content, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion) combined to determine the three components of flammability (ignitability, sustainability and combustibility) at the leaf and plant scales in 25 grass species of fire-prone South African grasslands at a time of peak fire occurrence. The influence of evolutionary history on flammability was assessed based on a phylogeny built here for the study species.Grass species differed significantly in all components of flammability. Accounting for evolutionary history helped to explain patterns in leaf-scale combustibility and sustainability. The five measured plant traits predicted components of flammability, particularly leaf ignitability and plant combustibility in which 70\% and 58\% of variation, respectively, could be explained by a combination of the traits. Total above-ground biomass was a key driver of combustibility and sustainability with high biomass species burning more intensely and for longer, and producing the highest predicted fire spread rates. Moisture content was the main influence on ignitability, where species with higher moisture contents took longer to ignite and once alight burnt at a slower rate. Biomass density, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion were weaker predictors of flammability components. Synthesis. We demonstrate that grass flammability is predicted from easily measurable plant functional traits and is influenced by evolutionary history with some components showing phylogenetic signal. Grasses are not homogenous fuels to fire. Rather, species differ in functional traits that in turn demonstrably influence flammability. This diversity is consistent with the idea that flammability may be an adaptive trait for grasses of fire-prone ecosystems.},

  abstract = {1 The enhancement of biodiversity in meadow grassland, an environmental aim of European agricultural policy, requires definition of appropriate management regimes and the rate at which they enhance biodiversity and change ecosystem properties. We describe vegetation changes in a 10-year trial on mesotrophic grassland that was previously agriculturally improved, plus change in the soil microbial community and fertility, important factors that influence biodiversity. 2 Management treatments were three hay-cut dates, plus two mineral fertilizer, two seed addition and two farmyard manure (FYM) applications. Treatment combinations included the traditional management regime (21 July hay-cut date, no mineral fertilizer, autumn grazing with cattle, spring grazing with sheep), modern variants of this (14 June hay-cut date, mineral fertilizer) and exceptional historic variants (1 September hay-cut date). 3 Sowing seed increased species richness and, in the absence of fertilizer and FYM, produced a plant community similar to Geranium sylvaticum\textendash Anthoxanthum odouratum grassland. The greatest cover of sown species was found in seeded treatments, cut for hay on 21 July, in the absence of mineral fertilizer. The target plant community (MG3b grassland) was most rapidly achieved with a 21 July hay cut. Initial decrease in Ellenberg fertility scores only persisted in the 21 July and 1 September cut dates when mineral fertilizer was absent. Soil phosphate was lowest in the joint absence of mineral fertilizer and FYM. 4 There were few treatment effects on the soil microflora. Bacterial biomass was reduced when FYM was applied with the 14 June cut date, but increased when FYM was applied with the 1 September cut date. Fungal biomass decreased when mineral fertilizer was applied. 5 Increased species richness, primarily through an increase in legumes, stress-tolerant and stress-tolerant ruderal plant strategists, was associated with an increase in soil fungi and the abundance of fungi relative to bacteria. All these were associated with seed addition to unfertilized plots cut on 21 July, in the absence of FYM, indicating a functional role for individual species. 6 Synthesis and applications. The enhancement of biodiversity in meadow grassland is a long-term ({$>$} 10-year) secondary succession, most rapidly achieved in the absence of mineral fertilizer by cutting for hay in mid-July and autumn grazing with cattle. The sowing of key functional species, i.e. legumes and Rhinanthus minor, was important in facilitating the staged colonization of other sown species.},

  abstract = {1 Restoration of high plant species diversity to sites where it has been reduced by intensive grassland management requires identification of appropriate management regimes. Understanding the combinatorial effects of management on above-ground vegetation and below-ground microbial communities will inform management prescriptions on how best to increase plant diversity, restore rare vegetation types and achieve agri-environmental objectives. 2 Changes in vegetation and soil microbial community structure are described from the second phase of a 1990\textendash 2004 field trial that investigated the interacting effects of fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) treatments imposed after 1998, in the context of previous hay-cut date and seed-addition treatments. 3 Hay-cut date was the main factor influencing plant species composition in phase 1, whereas FYM was the dominant factor in phase 2. 4 Poa trivialis and Lolium perenne increased in abundance with FYM application, particularly in combination with mineral fertilizer, and particularly in 2002 after the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic. The lowest Ellenberg fertility scores were associated with absence of FYM and mineral fertilizer but with addition of seed. 5 The highest plant species diversity in phase 2 was associated with seed addition and the absence of mineral fertilizer, an effect that had probably persisted from phase 1. Progressive development of the target traditional meadow vegetation occurred through phase 2. 6 Fungal:bacterial (F:B) ratios, a measure of changes in the relative abundance of fungi and bacteria in the microbial community, generally increased from 1996 to 2004, and were particularly high in the seed-addition treatments and in the absence of fertilizer. Here the high F:B ratios were associated with species (including legumes) typical of traditionally managed mesotrophic grassland in northern England. 7 Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that biodiversity goals for upland meadows need to plan beyond the typical 5\textendash 10-year management agreement period of agri-environment schemes. Combination treatments, in which seed addition is vital, alongside appropriate fertilizer, FYM, hay-cut date and grazing regimes, are needed for grassland restoration. However, even after 14 years the most effective treatment combinations had still not restored the target species composition and diversity. The demonstrated change in soil microbial communities, linked to the growth of legumes, might be important to facilitate future increases in plant diversity.},

We compiled and digitized data about plant mycorrhizal colonization in nine widespread languages. The present version of the FungalRoot database contains 36 303 species-by-site observations for 14 870 plant species, tripling the previously available compiled information about plant mycorrhizal associations. Based on these data, we provide a recommended list of genus-level plant mycorrhizal associations, based on the majority of data for species and careful analysis of conflicting data. The majority of ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants are trees (92\%) and shrubs (85\%), respectively. The majority of arbuscular and nonmycorrhizal plant species are herbaceous (50\% and 70\%, respectively). Our publicly available database is a powerful resource for mycorrhizal scientists and ecologists. It features possibilities for dynamic updating and addition of data about plant mycorrhizal associations. The new database will promote research on plant and fungal biogeography and evolution, and on links between above- and belowground biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of research on the species-pool concept and the recent explosion of interest in trait-based frameworks in ecology and biogeography, surprisingly little is known about how spatial and temporal changes in species-pool functional diversity (SPFD) influence biodiversity and the processes underlying community assembly. Current trait-based frameworks focus primarily on community assembly from a static regional species pool, without considering how spatial or temporal variation in SPFD alters the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. Likewise, species-pool concepts primarily focus on how the number of species in the species pool influences local biodiversity. However, species pools with similar richness can vary substantially in functional-trait diversity, which can strongly influence community assembly and biodiversity responses to environmental change. Here, we integrate recent advances in community ecology, trait-based ecology, and biogeography to provide a more comprehensive framework that explicitly considers how variation in SPFD, among regions and within regions through time, influences the relative importance of community assembly processes and patterns of biodiversity. First, we provide a brief overview of the primary ecological and evolutionary processes that create differences in SPFD among regions and within regions through time. We then illustrate how SPFD may influence fundamental processes of local community assembly (dispersal, ecological drift, niche selection). Higher SPFD may increase the relative importance of deterministic community assembly when greater functional diversity in the species pool increases niche selection across environmental gradients. In contrast, lower SPFD may increase the relative importance of stochastic community assembly when high functional redundancy in the species pool increases the influence of dispersal history or ecological drift. Next, we outline experimental and observational approaches for testing the influence of SPFD on assembly processes and biodiversity. Finally, we highlight applications of this framework for restoration and conservation. This species-pool functional diversity framework has the potential to advance our understanding of how local- and regional-scale processes jointly influence patterns of biodiversity across biogeographic regions, changes in biodiversity within regions over time, and restoration outcomes and conservation efforts in ecosystems altered by environmental change.},

Interactions between herbivory and fire may set up a potential tradeoff axis, along which unique adaptations contribute to structuring communities and determining species distributions. We examine the role of herbivory and fire in structuring distributions of Acacia saplings in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in South Africa, and the relationship of species' niche structure to traits that help them survive herbivory or fire. Results suggest that (1) fire and herbivory form a single trade-off axis, (2) Acacia sapling distributions are constrained by fire and herbivory, and (3) Acacia saplings have adaptations that are structured by the tradeoff axis. Herbivory-adapted species tend to have 'cage'-like architecture, thicker bark, and less starch storage, while fire-adapted species tend to have 'pole'-like architecture, relatively thinner bark, and more starch storage.},

  abstract = {Biotic resistance and disturbance are fundamental processes influencing plant invasion outcomes; however, the role of consumers in regulating the establishment and spread of plant invaders and how disturbance modifies biotic resistance by consumers is unclear. We document that fire in combination with experimental exclusion of rodent consumers shifted a native desert shrubland to a low-diversity, invasive annual grassland dominated by Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). In contrast, burned plots with rodents present suppressed invasion by cheatgrass and developed into a more diverse forb community. Rodents created strong biotic resistance to the establishment of aggressive plant invaders likely through seed and seedling predation, which had cascading effects on plant competition and plant community diversity. Fire mediated its positive effects on plant invaders through native plant removal and by decreasing the abundance and diversity of the rodent community. The experimental disruption of plant and consumer-mediated biotic resistance of plant invaders using fire and rodent exclusion treatments provides strong evidence that native plants and rodents are important regulators of plant invasion dynamics and plant biodiversity in our study system. While rodents conferred strong resistance to invasion in our study system, fluctuations in rodent populations due to disturbance and climatic events may provide windows of opportunity for exotic plant species to escape biotic resistance by rodent consumers and initiate invasions.},

  abstract = {So far, seed limitation as a local process, and dispersal limitation as a regional process have been largely neglected in biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning research. However, these processes can influence both local plant species diversity and ecosystem processes, such as biomass production. We added seeds of 60 species from the regional species pool to grassland communities at 20 montane grassland sites in Germany. In these sites, plant species diversity ranged from 10 to 34 species m-2 and, before manipulation, diversity was not related to aboveground biomass, which ranged from 108 to 687 g m-2. One year after seed addition, local plant species richness had increased on average by six species m-2 (29\%) compared with control plots, and this increase was highest in grasslands with intermediate productivity. The increased diversity after adding seeds was associated with an average increase of aboveground biomass of 36 g m-2 (14.8\%) compared with control plots. Thus, our results demonstrate that a positive relationship between changes in species richness and productivity, as previously reported from experimental plant communities, also holds for natural grassland ecosystems. Our results show that local plant communities are dispersal limited and a hump-shaped model appears to be the limiting outline of the natural diversity\textendash productivity relationship. Hence, the effects of dispersal on local diversity can substantially affect the functioning of natural ecosystems.},

Theoretically, fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity is an important driver of biodiversity because it captures the range of resources available in a given area. In this study we investigated how bird species richness and birds grouped by various ecological traits responded to vegetation cover and heterogeneity. We found that both fine-scale vegetation cover (of tall trees, medium-sized trees and shrubs) and heterogeneity (of tall trees, and shrubs) were important predictors of bird richness, but the direction of the response of bird richness to shrub heterogeneity differed between sites with different proportions of tall tree cover. For example, bird richness increased with shrub heterogeneity in sites with high levels of tall tree cover, but declined in sites with low levels of tall tree cover. Our findings indicated that an increase in vegetation heterogeneity will not always result in an increase in resources and niches, and associated higher species richness. We also found birds grouped by traits responded in a predictable way to vegetation heterogeneity. For example, we found small birds benefited from increased shrub heterogeneity supporting the textual discontinuity hypothesis and non-arboreal (ground or shrub) nesting species were associated with high vegetation cover (low heterogeneity). Our results indicated that focusing solely on increasing vegetation cover (e.g. through restoration) may be detrimental to particular animal groups. Findings from this investigation can help guide habitat management for different functional groups of birds.},

Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.},

Among the 450 kurgans visited during the growing seasons 2004\textendash 2010, 106 best preserved kurgans were investigated. Of 721 species identified, 69 were sozophytes (species of special concern), threatened with extinction. They were usually recorded on the slopes of kurgans and were mostly associated with communities from the classes Festuco-Brometea and Festucetea vaginatae. The distributional patterns of the most frequent sozophytes within kurgans coming from four different climatic-vegetation zones were analyzed. Our study confirmed that kurgans could play a role as refugia of the steppe flora. However, the spatial isolation (about 82\textendash 90\% of the Ukrainian steppe was turned in agricultural land) and relatively small populations of sozophytes do not contribute to their survival. Other threats to kurgan flora include the following: a direct destruction of the kurgans by frequent fires, excessive grazing, cultivation practices, human activities, e.g. archeological excavations, or illegal activities of archeological looters. The active conservation of kurgans as archeological sites, as well as areas of high floristic value is recommended.},

Here, we examined the roles of plant species identity, phylogeny and functional traits in shaping rhizosphere fungal communities and tested the robustness of these relationships to environmental change. We conducted a glasshouse experiment consisting of 21 temperate grassland species grown under three different environmental treatments and characterised the fungal communities within the rhizosphere of these plants. We found that plant species identity, plant phylogenetic relatedness and plant traits all affected rhizosphere fungal community composition. Trait relationships with fungal communities were primarily driven by interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and root traits were stronger predictors of fungal communities than leaf traits. These patterns were independent of the environmental treatments the plants were grown under. Our results showcase the key role of plant root traits, especially root diameter, root nitrogen and specific root length, in driving rhizosphere fungal community composition, demonstrating the potential for root traits to be used within predictive frameworks of plant?fungal relationships. Furthermore, we highlight how key limitations in our understanding of fungal function may obscure previously unmeasured plant?fungal interactions.},

  abstract = {Changes in species diversity often result from species losses and gains. The dynamic nature of beta diversity (spatial variation in species composition) that derives from such temporal species turnover, however, has received relatively little attention. Here, we disentangled extinction and colonization components of beta diversity by using the sets of species that went locally extinct and that newly colonized the study sites. We applied this concept of extinction and colonization beta diversity to ground vegetation communities that have been repeatedly surveyed in forests where fire and harvesting were experimentally applied. We first found that fire and harvesting caused no effect on beta diversity 2 yr after the treatments. From this result, we might conclude that they did not alter the ways in which species assemble across space. However, when we analyzed the extinction and colonization beta diversity between pre-treatment and 2 yr after the treatments, both measures were found to be significantly lower in burned sites compared to unburned sites (i.e., the groups of excluded and newly colonized species both showed low beta diversity in the burned sites). These results indicate that the fire excluded similar subsets of species across space, making communities become more heterogeneous, but at the same time induced spatially uniform colonization of new species, causing communities to homogenize. Consequently, the effects of these two processes canceled each other out. The relative importance of extinction and colonization components per se also changed temporally after the treatments. Fire and harvesting showed synergetic negative impacts on extinction beta diversity between pre-treatment and 10 yr after the treatments. Overall, analyses using extinction and colonization beta diversity allowed us to detect nonrandom disassembly and reassembly dynamics in ground vegetation communities. Our results suggest that common practices of analyzing beta diversity at one point in time can mask significant variation driven by disturbance. Acknowledging the extinction\textendash colonization dynamics behind beta diversity is essential for understanding the spatiotemporal organization of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial biomass is a key determinant of carbon dynamics in the soil. Several studies have shown that soil microbial biomass significantly increases with plant species diversity, but it remains unclear whether plant species diversity can also stabilize soil microbial biomass in a changing environment. This question is particularly relevant as many global environmental change (GEC) factors, such as drought and nutrient enrichment, have been shown to reduce soil microbial biomass. Experiments with orthogonal manipulations of plant diversity and GEC factors can provide insights whether plant diversity can attenuate such detrimental effects on soil microbial biomass. Here, we present the analysis of 12 different studies with 14 unique orthogonal plant diversity~\texttimes ~GEC manipulations in grasslands, where plant diversity and at least one GEC factor (elevated CO2 , nutrient enrichment, drought, earthworm presence, or warming) were manipulated. Our results show that higher plant diversity significantly enhances soil microbial biomass with the strongest effects in long-term field experiments. In contrast, GEC factors had inconsistent effects with only drought having a significant negative effect. Importantly, we report consistent non-significant effects for all 14 interactions between plant diversity and GEC factors, which indicates a limited potential of plant diversity to attenuate the effects of GEC factors on soil microbial biomass. We highlight that plant diversity is a major determinant of soil microbial biomass in experimental grasslands that can influence soil carbon dynamics irrespective of GEC.},

However, diversity-stability relationships (DSRs) are analysed using a variety of different population and community properties, most of which are adopted from theory that makes several restrictive assumptions that are unlikely to be reflected in nature. Here, we construct a simple synthesis and generalisation of previous theory for the DSR. We show that community stability is a product of two quantities: the synchrony of population fluctuations, and an average species-level population stability that is weighted by relative abundance. Weighted average population stability can be decomposed to consider effects of the mean-variance scaling of abundance, changes in mean abundance with diversity and differences in species' mean abundance in monoculture. Our framework makes explicit how unevenness in the abundances of species in real communities influences the DSR, which occurs both through effects on community synchrony, and effects on weighted average population variability. This theory provides a more robust framework for analysing the results of empirical studies of the DSR, and facilitates the integration of findings from real and model communities.},

New research is required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R2) changes when habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in local ({$\alpha$}) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.},

Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity-stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.},

We use a consumer-resource model to explore how coexistence via the temporal storage effect and relative nonlinearity affects ecosystem variability. We show that a positive, rather than negative, diversity-ecosystem variability relationship is possible when ecosystem function is sampled across a natural gradient in environmental variability and diversity. We also show how fluctuation-dependent coexistence can buffer ecosystem functioning against increasing environmental variability by promoting species richness and portfolio effects. Our work provides a general explanation for variation in observed diversity-ecosystem variability relationships and highlights the importance of conserving regional species pools to help buffer ecosystems against predicted increases in environmental variability.},

  abstract = {Understanding biodiversity changes in the Anthropocene (e.g. due to climate and land-use change) is an urgent ecological issue. This important task is challenging because global change effects and species responses are dependent on the spatial scales considered. Furthermore, responses are often not immediate. However, both scale and time delay issues can be tackled when, at each study site, we consider dynamics in both observed and dark diversity. Dark diversity includes those species in the region that can potentially establish and thrive in the local sites' conditions but are currently locally absent. Effectively, dark diversity connects biodiversity at the study site to the regional scales and defines the site-specific species pool (observed and dark diversity together). With dark diversity, it is possible to decompose species gains and losses into two space-related components: one associated with local dynamics (species moving from observed to dark diversity and vice versa) and another related to gains and losses of site-specific species pool (species moving to and from the pool after regional immigration, regional extinction or change in local ecological conditions). Extinction debt and immigration credit are useful to understand dynamics in observed diversity, but delays might happen in species pool changes as well. In this opinion piece we suggest that considering both observed and dark diversity and their temporal dynamics provides a deeper understanding of biodiversity changes. Considering both observed and dark diversity creates opportunities to improve conservation by allowing to identify species that are likely to go regionally extinct as well as foreseeing which of the species that newly arrive to the region are more likely to colonize local sites. Finally, by considering temporal lags and species gains and losses in observed and dark diversity, we combine phenomena at both spatial and temporal scales, providing a novel tool to examine biodiversity change in the Anthropocene.},

As a consequence, active restoration may be necessary to overcome land-use legacies; however, few studies have evaluated the joint effects of agricultural history and restoration on ecological communities. Those that have studied this joint effect have largely focused on plants and ignored other communities, such as soil microbes. We conducted a large-scale experiment to understand how agricultural history and restoration tree thinning affect soil bacterial and fungal communities within longleaf pine savannas of the southern United States. This experiment contained 64 pairs of remnant (no history of tillage agriculture) and post-agricultural (reforested following abandonment from tillage agriculture {$>$}60 years prior) longleaf pine savanna plots. Plots were each 1 ha and arranged into 27 blocks to minimize land-use decision-making biases. We experimentally restored half of the remnant and post-agricultural plots by thinning trees to reinstate open-canopy savanna conditions and collected soils from all plots five growing seasons after tree thinning. We then evaluated soil bacterial and fungal communities using metabarcoding. Agricultural history increased bacterial diversity but decreased fungal diversity, while restoration increased both bacterial and fungal diversity. Both bacterial and fungal richness were correlated with a range of environmental variables including above-ground variables like leaf litter and plant diversity, and below-ground variables such as soil nutrients, pH and organic matter, many of which were also impacted by agricultural history and restoration. Fungal and bacterial community compositions were shaped by restoration and agricultural history resulting in four distinct communities across the four treatment combinations. Synthesis and applications. Past agricultural land use has left persistent legacies on soil microbial biodiversity, even over half a century after agricultural abandonment and after intensive restoration activities. The impacts of these changes on soil microbe biodiversity could influence native plant establishment, plant productivity and other aspects of ecosystem functioning following agricultural abandonment and during restoration.},

An urban\textendash rural gradient approach was used to examine changes in plant species composition and abundance related to human-altered habitats in the Western Siberian city of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan). This region is characterized by harsh continental environmental conditions and recent anthropogenic degradation of the original steppe grasslands as a result of enforced land-use changes (Virgin Land Campaign) and rapidly expanding urbanization. Plant diversity and abundance as well as the percentage of alien species were recorded in plots on four 20-km long transect lines running from the city centre to the rural surroundings. Various habitat and landscape characteristics were assessed along the transect lines to describe the urban\textendash rural gradient. Based on the results of a principal component analysis considering these landscape characteristics the variable ``distance to the city centre'' was used as proxy for the urban\textendash rural gradient. Plant diversity increased with increasing distance to the city centre and was also influenced by the type of land use (ornamentally managed, agricultural or unmanaged land) and the percentage cover of built-up area within a 500 m radius. The percentage of alien species decreased from 45\% in the city centre to 23\% in the rural surroundings. The percentage of species belonging to different plant life forms and to different evolutionary strategies were affected by different landscape characteristics. The study showed that the combined effects of expanding urbanization and agricultural land-use changes altered the plant species composition.},

Burning is an alternative tool to regulate biomass dynamics in semi-natural grasslands even in the absence of grazing or mowing. We tested the effects of regular spring burning on the biomass fractions and fine-scale plant species composition of species-rich foothill grasslands in North-Hungary. There were five regularly burned and five control grasslands in the study; we collected twenty 20\texttimes 20-cm sized biomass samples from each. We analyzed the main fractions (litter, graminoid and forb biomass), and the species-level biomass scores, and flowering success in the control and burned grasslands. We revealed that fire increased the amount of forb biomass and decreased the amount of litter, which suggested that regular burning might be feasible for regulating biomass dynamics. The non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) showed a high similarity of the control and burned grasslands in species composition. However, plant diversity, and the number of flowering shoots decreased significantly in the burned grasslands. In regularly burned sites we found a significant decline of specialist species, as well as of steppic flora elements. Our results showed that besides its positive effect on biomass dynamics, high-frequency burning threatens the overall diversity and specialist plant species in semi-natural grasslands. We recommend that proper fire regimes should be first studied experimentally, to provide a scientific basis for the application of prescribed burning management in such habitats.},

They create distinct habitat patches by building burrows: they move large amounts of soil, mix soil layers and change soil properties locally. Our aim was to explore the role of Steppe Marmot as an ecosystem engineer in shaping the plant species composition and diversity of steppes. First, we made a literature search to gather information on the ecosystem engineering effect of the species. Second, in a case study, we compared the vegetation of marmot burrows with the surrounding intact steppes in North-Kazakhstan to identify differences in species composition and plant functional groups. Vegetation of the burrows was structurally and compositionally different from the intact steppe vegetation. Burrows were characterised by lower total vegetation cover, higher cover of annuals and lower cover of perennial grasses compared to the intact steppe. We found an increased cover of ruderal species on the burrows, but also several specialist species, such as Agropyron cristatum, Anabasis salsa, Kochia prostrata and Petrosimonia spp. were confined to the burrow vegetation. Our results suggest that marmot burrows increase the landscape-scale heterogeneity of the steppe vegetation and could act as stepping stones for the dispersal of several steppe-specialist species.},

  abstract = {Approximately 25 years ago, ecologists became increasingly interested in the question of whether ongoing biodiversity loss matters for the functioning of ecosystems. As such, a new ecological subfield on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) was born. This subfield was initially dominated by theoretical studies and by experiments in which biodiversity was manipulated, and responses of ecosystem functions such as biomass production, decomposition rates, carbon sequestration, trophic interactions and pollination were assessed. More recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated BEF relationships in non-manipulated ecosystems, but reviews synthesizing our knowledge on the importance of real-world biodiversity are still largely missing. I performed a systematic review in order to assess how biodiversity drives ecosystem functioning in both terrestrial and aquatic, naturally assembled communities, and on how important biodiversity is compared to other factors, including other aspects of community composition and abiotic conditions. The outcomes of 258 published studies, which reported 726 BEF relationships, revealed that in many cases, biodiversity promotes average biomass production and its temporal stability, and pollination success. For decomposition rates and ecosystem multifunctionality, positive effects of biodiversity outnumbered negative effects, but neutral relationships were even more common. Similarly, negative effects of prey biodiversity on pathogen and herbivore damage outnumbered positive effects, but were less common than neutral relationships. Finally, there was no evidence that biodiversity is related to soil carbon storage. Most BEF studies focused on the effects of taxonomic diversity, however, metrics of functional diversity were generally stronger predictors of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, in most studies, abiotic factors and functional composition (e.g. the presence of a certain functional group) were stronger drivers of ecosystem functioning than biodiversity per se. While experiments suggest that positive biodiversity effects become stronger at larger spatial scales, in naturally assembled communities this idea is too poorly studied to draw general conclusions. In summary, a high biodiversity in naturally assembled communities positively drives various ecosystem functions. At the same time, the strength and direction of these effects vary highly among studies, and factors other than biodiversity can be even more important in driving ecosystem functioning. Thus, to promote those ecosystem functions that underpin human well-being, conservation should not only promote biodiversity per se, but also the abiotic conditions favouring species with suitable trait combinations.},

In addition, propagule addition experiments have shown that dispersal often limits local diversity. However, actual dispersal rates into local communities and the contribution of immigrants to observed local diversity are poorly known. We present a new approach that partitions the diversity of a target community into dispersal-maintained and dispersal-independent components. Specifically, we quantify distances through space and time to the nearest potential seed source for naturally occurring recruits in target communities by using hierarchical data on species pools (local, site, region, and seed bank). Using this "recruit tag" approach, we found that dispersal contributed 29\%-57\% of the seedling diversity in perennial grasslands with different successional histories. However, both dispersal and seedling mortality remained remarkably constant, in absolute terms, over succession. The considerable loss of diversity over secondary succession (66\%), therefore, could be understood only by considering how these processes interact with the decreasing disturbance rate (i.e., frequency of gaps) in later-successional sites. We conclude that a metacommunity perspective is relevant and necessary to understand the diversity and community assembly of this study system.},

  abstract = {Many grassland biodiversity experiments show a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, however, in most of these experiments plant communities are established by sowing and natural colonization is prevented by selective weeding of non-sown species. During ecosystem restoration, for example on abandoned fields, plant communities start on bare soil, and diversity is often manipulated in a single sowing event. How such initial plant diversity manipulations influence plant biodiversity development and ecosystem functioning is not well understood. We examined how relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity, biomass production and stability develop over 16 yr in non-weeded plots sown with 15 species, four species, or that were not sown. We found that sown plant communities become functionally similar to unsown, naturally colonized plant communities. However, initial sowing treatments had long-lasting effects on species composition and taxonomic diversity. We found only few relationships between biomass production, or stability in biomass production, and functional or taxonomic diversity, and the ones we observed were negative. In addition, the cover of dominant plant species was positively related to biomass production and stability. We conclude that effects of introducing plant species at the start of secondary succession can persist for a long time, and that in secondary succession communities with natural plant species dynamics diversity\textendash functioning relationships can be weak or negative. Moreover, our findings indicate that in systems where natural colonization of species is allowed effects of plant dominance may underlie diversity\textendash functioning relationships.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Importance weighting is a general way to adjust Monte Carlo integration to account for draws from the wrong distribution, but the resulting estimate can be noisy when the importance ratios have a heavy right tail. This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

Biologically rich grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands suffer from an image problem among scientists, policy makers, land managers, and the general public, that fosters alarming rates of ecosystem destruction and degradation. These biomes have for too long been misrepresented as the result of deforestation followed by arrested succession. We now know that grassy biomes originated millions of years ago, long before humans began deforesting. We present a consensus view from diverse geographic regions on the ecological characteristics needed to identify old-growth grasslands and to distinguish them from recently formed anthropogenic vegetation. If widely adopted, the old-growth grassland concept has the potential to improve scientific understanding, conservation policies, and ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Governments have agreed to expand the global protected area network from 13\% to 17\% of the world's land surface by 2020 (Aichi target 11) and to prevent the further loss of known threatened species (Aichi target 12). These targets are interdependent, as protected areas can stem biodiversity loss when strategically located and effectively managed. However, the global protected area estate is currently biased toward locations that are cheap to protect and away from important areas for biodiversity. Here we use data on the distribution of protected areas and threatened terrestrial birds, mammals, and amphibians to assess current and possible future coverage of these species under the convention. We discover that 17\% of the 4,118 threatened vertebrates are not found in a single protected area and that fully 85\% are not adequately covered (i.e., to a level consistent with their likely persistence). Using systematic conservation planning, we show that expanding protected areas to reach 17\% coverage by protecting the cheapest land, even if ecoregionally representative, would increase the number of threatened vertebrates covered by only 6\%. However, the nonlinear relationship between the cost of acquiring land and species coverage means that fivefold more threatened vertebrates could be adequately covered for only 1.5 times the cost of the cheapest solution, if cost efficiency and threatened vertebrates are both incorporated into protected area decision making. These results are robust to known errors in the vertebrate range maps. The Convention on Biological Diversity targets may stimulate major expansion of the global protected area estate. If this expansion is to secure a future for imperiled species, new protected areas must be sited more strategically than is presently the case.},

In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.},

Here, we tested under glasshouse conditions how plant community attributes, including variations in the dominance, diversity and range of plant functional traits, influence N uptake and retention in temperate grassland. We added a pulse of (15) N to grassland plant communities assembled to represent a range of community-weighted mean plant traits, trait functional diversity and divergence, and species richness, and measured plant and microbial uptake of (15) N, and leaching losses of (15) N, as a short-term test of N retention in the plant-soil system. Root biomass, herb abundance and dominant plant traits were the main determinants of N retention in the plant-soil system: greater root biomass and herb abundance, and lower root tissue density, increased plant (15) N uptake, while higher specific leaf area and root tissue density increased microbial (15) N uptake. Our results provide novel, mechanistic insight into the short-term fate of N in the plant-soil system, and show that dominant plant traits, rather than trait functional diversity, control the fate of added N in the plant-soil system.},

  abstract = {Green hay transfer from species-rich donor sites is now commonly used in Europe to restore species-rich semi-natural grassland, both on ex-arable land and on former intensive grassland. However, species transfer rates are usually well below 100\%, and due to lack of further colonization by additional target species after initial restoration, continued progress toward the target plant community is often very slow. We used data from a restoration experiment aiming to reestablish species-rich grazed meadows of the MG5 grassland type according to the British National Vegetation Classification to investigate relationships between species abundance at a donor site, species capture by green hay and its seed content, and success of species establishment on experimental plots in formerly intensively managed species-poor grassland undergoing restoration. Our results show that species with higher abundance at the donor site were more likely captured as seed in green hay, and were more likely to establish after hay application at the recipient site. Species with low abundance at the donor site that also possessed specific germination requirements that might prevent immediate establishment after green hay transfer were particularly unlikely to get established after transfer. These findings can provide guidance for additional measures aimed at ensuring establishment of a wider range of target species. Such measures could include targeted sowing of species in addition to green hay application, and management of restored grassland swards to extend or reopen an initial window of opportunity for the establishment of green hay species that might not be germinable immediately after hay transfer.},

In northwest Europe, because high N deposition is considered the main driver of plant diversity loss, European Union (EU) legislation to reduce N deposition is expected to promote plant species recovery. However, this expectation is simplistic: it ignores the role of other macronutrients. Analysing the relationship between plant species pools and species stoichiometric niches along nutrient gradients across northern Eurasia's herbaceous ecosystems, we found that both absolute and relative P availability are more critical than N or K availability. This result is consistent with stoichiometric niche theory, and with findings from studies of hyperdiverse forests and shrublands at lower latitudes. We show that ecosystems with low absolute and relative P availability harbour a unique set of threatened species that have narrower nutrient-based niche widths than non-threatened species. Such ecosystems represent a conservation priority, but may be further threatened by latent effects of relative P enrichment arising from reduction of N availability without simultaneous reduction of P. The narrow focus of EU legislation on reducing N, but not P, may therefore inadvertently increase the threat to many of Europe's already threatened plant species. An EU Phosphate Directive is needed.},

  abstract = {Priority effects refer to the order or timing of species arrival, including how species that arrive early at a site either positively or negatively affect establishment, growth, or reproduction of species that arrive later. Despite the clear implications of priority effects for ecological restoration, there have been no reviews of how and where priority effects have been studied and the extent to which findings can be applied to restoration. Here, we systematically review the literature on priority effects by (1) synthesizing information from papers that compared simultaneous and nonsimultaneous planting or sowing; (2) discussing the mechanisms through which priority effects operate, (3) considering how these mechanisms might be manipulated to achieve restoration goals; and (4) highlighting future research needed to improve the use of priority effects in restoration. In a term-targeted search, we found 43 studies that experimentally manipulated the order of arrival of different species. Overall, these concluded that even small delays in arrival time, as opposed to simultaneous arrival of species, can promote differences in subsequent community composition as well as ecosystem functions. There were very few studies on the long-term stability of these priority effects, and the majority were conducted in temperate grasslands. Our findings suggest that creating alternative vegetation states via priority treatments is a promising avenue for restoration. However, for the concept to be best operationalized for restoration, we need research in more ecosystems that are priorities for restoration, and treatments that are followed over extended time periods.},

  abstract = {The break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered cropland abandonment on a continental scale, which in turn led to carbon accumulation on abandoned land across Eurasia. Previous studies have estimated carbon accumulation rates across Russia based on large-scale modelling. Studies that assess carbon sequestration on abandoned land based on robust field sampling are rare. We investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks using a randomized sampling design along a climatic gradient from forest steppe to sub taiga in Western Siberia (Tyumen province). In total, SOC contents were sampled on 470 plots across different soil and land-use types. The effect of land use on changes in SOC stock was evaluated and carbon sequestration rates calculated for different age stages of abandoned cropland. While land-use type had an effect on carbon accumulation in the topsoil (0-5 cm), no independent land-use effects were found for deeper SOC stocks. Topsoil carbon stocks of grasslands and forests were significantly higher than those of soils managed for crops and under abandoned cropland. SOC increased significantly with time since abandonment. The average carbon sequestration rate for soils of abandoned cropland was 0.66 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (1-20 years old, 0-5 cm soil depth), which is at the lower end of published estimates for Russia and Siberia. There was a tendency towards SOC saturation on abandoned land as sequestration rates were much higher for recently abandoned (1-10 years old, 1.04 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) compared to earlier abandoned crop fields (11-20 years old, 0.26 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ). Our study confirms the global significance of abandoned cropland in Russia for carbon sequestration. Our findings also suggest that robust regional surveys based on a large number of samples advance model-based continent wide SOC prediction. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Question: How do standard multivariate classification algorithms perform for Mongolian dryland vegetation characterized by low diversity and very long floristic gradients?   Location: Southern Mongolian Gobi.   Methods: We compared several widely used classification methods based on 1231 relev\textasciiacute es obtained with a similar sampling method. We applied agglom- erative cluster algorithms (flexible beta/FLEX, average linkage/UPGMA, weighted linkage/WPGMA, complete linkage, Ward's clustering) and a divisive classification technique (TWINSPAN); data were reduced to presence/absence. We compared results against a published phytosociological classification (PHY-TO), against environmental background data, and with respect to the presence of significant indicator species.   Results: Complete linkage was inferior to other methods. TWINSPAN, UP- GMA, flexible beta and WPGMA gave partly similar clusters, with FLEX and WARD showing the highest pair-wise similarity. Classifications of all methods except CL partly agreed with PHYTO classification. Clusters of all methods had significant indicator species, but Ward's method had the highest number of indicator species, followed by the PHYTO classification and FLEX, TWINSPAN, UPGMA and WPGMA. The latter four methods all yielded clusters that differed in terms of precipitation, but TWINSPAN, FLEX and Ward's method performed best under this criterion. PHYTO and CL ranked last in partitioning the precipitation gradient. Comparisons with ordinations indicated that classification algorithms capture the main floristic gradient but were less successful than the phytosociological approach to elucidate the finer structures.   Conclusion: Performance of classification methods differed depending on the applied validation approach and we thus caution against uncritically adopting a single evaluation/validation criterion. Most numerical approaches can aid sorting of large data sets, while details of manual syntaxonomic classifications are not easily reproduced. Choice of the most appropriate classification and validation method thus clearly depends on the overall aim of a given study.},

  abstract = {Severe wildfires are increasing in extent in the western US. We used a matched-pairs design with plots in burned and non-burned areas to study effects of the East Amarillo Complex (EAC) wildfires on mixed grass prairie mean community composition and variability in composition. Species composition and ground cover data were collected at 5 study sites each year for three years following the EAC. Fire effects on mean species composition were analyzed with permutational analyses of variance; temporal patterns were analyzed with permutational anova and nonmetric multidimensional scaling; and an index of multivariate dispersion was used to assess variability in plant community composition. We found weak immediate impacts (year 1) of wildfire on mean species composition, but strong impacts by year three. Two general patterns of changes in mean species composition emerged: at 3 study sites, there was a progressive divergence in similarity between burned and non-burned areas following wildfire whereas at 2 study sites, wildfire effects lessened over time. In contrast, a trend of increased homogeneity in burned vegetation relative to non-burned vegetation was apparent at all 5 study sites 2 to 3 years post-fire; burned areas also had higher species diversity, higher evenness but similar species richness 3 years post-fire. Ground cover composition, which was immediately impacted by wildfire through removal of residual dry matter, was fully recovered to non-burned conditions 3 years after wildfire. We observed little seedling recruitment either of native or exotic species following wildfire. Community composition changes in burned areas were likely the result of changing dominance relationships among plants that survived the wildfires rather than the result of recruitment of new individuals in gaps created by dead plants. Given the growth form of perennial C4 grasses and the fact that these grasslands evolved in the context of repeated fire, it is likely that changes in mean species composition and compositional variability are short-term responses.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity assessments are crucial and increasingly used for understanding ecological processes and managing ecosystems. The functional diversity of a community is assessed by sampling traits at one or more scales (individuals, populations and species) and calculating a summary index of the variation in trait values. However, it remains unclear how the scales at which traits are sampled and the indices used to estimate functional diversity may alter the patterns observed and inferences about ecological processes. For 40 plant and 61 ant communities, we assess functional diversity using six methods\textemdash spanning various mean-based and probabilistic methods\textemdash that reflect common scenarios where different levels of detail are available in trait data. We test whether including trait variability at different scales (from individuals to species) alters functional diversity values calculated using the volume-based and dissimilarity-based indices, Functional Richness (FRic) and Rao, respectively. We further test whether such effects alter functional diversity patterns observed across communities and their relationships with environmental drivers such as abiotic gradients and occurrences of invasive species. Intraspecific trait variability strongly determined FRic and Rao. Methods using only species' mean trait values to calculate FRic (convex hulls) and Rao (Gower-based dissimilarity) distorted the patterns observed when intraspecific trait variability was considered. These distortions generated Type I and Type II errors for the effects of environmental factors structuring the plant and ant communities. A high sensitivity of FRic to individuals with extreme trait values was revealed in comparisons of different probabilistic methods including among-individual and among-population trait variability in functional diversity. In contrast, values of and ecological patterns in Rao were consistent among methods including different scales of intraspecific trait variability. Our results show empirically that decisions about where traits are sampled and how trait variability is included in functional diversity can drastically change the patterns observed and conclusions about ecological processes. We recommend sampling the traits of multiple individuals per species and capturing their intraspecific trait variability using probabilistic methods. We discuss how intraspecific trait variability can be reasonably estimated and included in functional diversity in the common circumstance where only limited trait data are available.},

  abstract = {In the US Corn Belt, a recent doubling in commodity prices has created incentives for landowners to convert grassland to corn and soybean cropping. Here, we use land cover data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer to assess grassland conversion from 2006 to 2011 in the Western Corn Belt (WCB): five states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. Our analysis identifies areas with elevated rates of grass-to-corn/soy conversion (1.0-5.4\% annually). Across the WCB, we found a net decline in grass-dominated land cover totaling nearly 530,000 ha. With respect to agronomic attributes of lands undergoing grassland conversion, corn/soy production is expanding onto marginal lands characterized by high erosion risk and vulnerability to drought. Grassland conversion is also concentrated in close proximity to wetlands, posing a threat to waterfowl breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region. Longer-term land cover trends from North Dakota and Iowa indicate that recent grassland conversion represents a persistent shift in land use rather than short-term variability in crop rotation patterns. Our results show that the WCB is rapidly moving down a pathway of increased corn and soybean cultivation. As a result, the window of opportunity for realizing the benefits of a biofuel industry based on perennial bioenergy crops, rather than corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, may be closing in the WCB.},

  abstract = {Although there is an increased understanding of fire's role in maintaining grassland ecosystems, few studies on vegetation develops after a fire disturbance has been reported in arid perennial grasslands on the Loess Plateau. To understand how vegetation recovers after a fire disturbance, we studied three grassland sites with different times since last fire in arid steppe on the Loess Plateau, China. Results showed that 2 years after a fire, total cover, species abundance, and diversity rapidly recovered and increased to higher than unburned grasslands. Rapid recovery after a fire disturbance was mainly attributed to the removal of litter which provided better microhabitats for lower dominance species and the vegetative regeneration of perennial species following fire. Fire has little effects on the composition ofgrassland species in the long run if the grasslands were dominated by perennial species because asexual recruitment plays an important role in the vegetation recovery after fire. The accumulated litter seems not a major reason explaining why fire does not significantly alter vegetation composition in studied grasslands. Low frequency fire is helpful to the renewal of grassland. Our results suggested that opportune fire is an effective regulator ofplant composition and maintenance in arid grassland.},

However, the potential context-dependency of biodiversity effects across ecosystem types, environmental conditions and carbon pools remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis by collecting data from 95 biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies across 60 sites to explore the effects of plant diversity on different C pools, including aboveground and belowground plant biomass, soil microbial biomass C and soil C content across different ecosystem types. The results showed that ecosystem C storage was significantly enhanced by plant diversity, with stronger effects on aboveground biomass than on soil C content. Moreover, the response magnitudes of ecosystem C storage increased with the level of species richness and experimental duration across all ecosystems. The effects of plant diversity were more pronounced in grasslands than in forests. Furthermore, the effects of plant diversity on belowground plant biomass increased with aridity index in grasslands and forests, suggesting that climate change might modulate biodiversity effects, which are stronger under wetter conditions but weaker under more arid conditions. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the important role of plant diversity in ecosystem C storage across critical C pools, ecosystem types and environmental contexts.},

The higher soil carbon storage rates of the second period (years 13\textendash 22) are associated with the greater aboveground production and root biomass of this period, and with the presence of multiple species, especially C4 grasses and legumes. Our results suggest that restoration of high plant diversity may greatly increase carbon capture and storage rates on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands.},

Here, we provide evidence from a long-term field manipulation of plant diversity that soil microbial communities, and the key ecosystem processes that they mediate, are significantly altered by plant species richness. After seven years of plant growth, we determined the composition and function of soil microbial communities beneath experimental plant diversity treatments containing 1\textendash 16 species. Microbial community biomass, respiration, and fungal abundance significantly increased with greater plant diversity, as did N mineralization rates. However, changes in microbial community biomass, activity, and composition largely resulted from the higher levels of plant production associated with greater diversity, rather than from plant diversity per se. Nonetheless, greater plant production could not explain more rapid N mineralization, indicating that plant diversity affected this microbial process, which controls rates of ecosystem N cycling. Greater N availability probably contributed to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity in the N-limited soils of our experiment, suggesting that plant\textendash microbe interactions in soil are an integral component of plant diversity's influence on ecosystem function.},

The impact of grazing on the presented communities is analysed in a comparable approach along the elevation gradient of decreasing aridity. While no obvious grazing response was detectable in the semidesert vegetation, mountainous vegetation revealed grazing-mediated communities characterised by survivors of the original associations and grazing indicators, by grazing-induced xerophytisation of the vegetation cover and an increasing spatial extent of grazing impact with rising elevations. Evolutionary history refl ecting the adaptation of arid and semi-arid ecosystems to grazing and the effective adaptation of management practices to the phenology patterns of vegetation are proposed as important factors of limited grazing impact on arid semidesert vegetation of the study area.},

We analyzed the inter-annual trends and the impact of climate variability in the vegetation greenness for Central Asia from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS3g normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. In our study, most areas showed an increasing trend during 1982\textendash 1991, but experienced a significantly decreasing trend for 1992\textendash 2011. Vegetation changes were closely coupled to climate variables (precipitation and temperature) during 1982\textendash 1991 and 1992\textendash 2011, but the response trajectories differed between these two periods. The warming trend in Central Asia initially enhanced the vegetation greenness before 1991, but the continued warming trend subsequently became a suppressant of further gains in greenness afterwards. Precipitation expanded its influence on larger vegetated areas in 1992\textendash 2011 when compared to 1982\textendash 1991. Moreover, the time-lag response of plants to rainfall tended to increase after 1992 compared to the pre-1992 period, indicating that plants might have experienced functional transformations to adapt the climate change during the study period. The impact of climate on vegetation was significantly different for the different sub-regions before and after 1992, coinciding with the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). It was suggested that these spatio-temporal patterns in greenness change and their relationship with climate change for some regions could be explained by the changes in the socio-economic structure resulted from the USSR collapse in late 1991. Our results clearly illustrate the combined influence of climatic/anthropogenic contributions on vegetation growth in Central Asian drylands. Due to the USSR collapse, this region represents a unique case study of the vegetation response to climate changes under different climatic and socio-economic conditions.},

However, it remains poorly understood how different aspects of biodiversity relate to multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) across heterogeneous landscapes, and how the magnitude of biodiversity, dominant species, and environmental effects on functioning compare. We compared relationships between plant phylogenetic, functional, and taxonomic diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality across 29 restored grasslands. Functional diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality, more strongly than other diversity measures; however, landscape composition explained nearly four times more variation in multifunctionality than did functional diversity, with plots within human-modified landscapes supporting lower multifunctionality. Individual functions were typically more strongly correlated with environmental variables than with diversity. We also found that abundance of the dominant species, Andropogon gerardii, was positively correlated with multifunctionality. Plant diversity, dominant species, and underlying environmental conditions underpin ecosystem multifunctionality in grasslands, but how biodiversity is measured matters for the strength and direction of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. Finally, in natural systems environmental variation unrelated to local biodiversity is important for determining ecosystem functioning. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Co-existence theories fail to adequately explain observed community patterns (diversity and composition) because they mainly address local extinctions. For a more complete understanding, the regional processes responsible for species formation and geographic dispersal should also be considered. The species pool concept holds that local variation in community patterns is dependent primarily on the availability of species, which is driven by historical diversification and dispersal at continental and landscape scales. However, empirical evidence of historical effects is limited. This slow progress can be attributed to methodological difficulties in determining the characteristics of historical species pools and how they contributed to diversity patterns in contemporary landscapes. A role of landscape-scale dispersal limitation in determining local community patterns has been demonstrated by numerous seed addition experiments. However, disentangling general patterns of dispersal limitation in communities still requires attention. Distinguishing habitat-specific species pools can help to meet both applied and theoretical challenges. In conservation biology, the use of absolute richness may be uninformative because the size of species pools varies between habitats. For characterizing the dynamic state of individual communities, biodiversity relative to species pools provides a balanced way of assessing communities in different habitats. Information about species pools may also be useful when studying community assembly rules, because it enables a possible mechanism of trait convergence (habitat filtering) to be explicitly assessed. Empirical study of the role of historic effects and dispersal on local community patterns has often been restricted due to methodological difficulties in determining habitat-specific species pools. However, accumulating distributional, ecological and phylogenetic information, as well as use of appropriate model systems (e.g. archipelagos with known biogeographic histories) will allow the species pool concept to be applied effectively in future research.},

  abstract = {During the second half of the 20th century Kalmykia has undergone severe desertification. Under Soviet rule, rangelands were increasingly devoted to animal production, and pastures were converted to cropland in a campaign to increase crops. Pastures were grazed two to three times their sustainable production, saiga populations and habitat greatly decreased, more than 17 million ha were subjected to wind erosion, 380,000 ha were transformed into moving sands, and 106,000 ha were ruined by secondary salinization and waterlogging. By the 1990s almost 80\% of the Republic had undergone desertification, and 13\% had been transformed into a true desert. In 1986 the General Scheme of Desertification Control was formulated. The scheme called for rotating pastures, reclaiming blown sand using silviculture, tilling overgrazed pastures and sowing fodder plants, and developing water supplies for pastures. In its early years the scheme has been successful. But the management of restored pastures usually reverts to the same farms responsible for the poor conditions, and there is great apprehension that degradation could reoccur. This case study concludes that the general cattle and agriculture development in Kalmykia is unviable for ecological and economic reasons, that Kalmykia should implement an adaptive policy oriented toward conservation and accommodating the interrelation and variability of land resources, that the desertification problem can be solved only by changing agrarian policy as a whole, and that a desertification control program must become an integral part of economic and social development of the Republic.},

  abstract = {Aim Fire is a natural disturbance in many ecosystems throughout the world where plant populations can persist by the resprouting of individuals and/or by recruiting from seeds. We evaluated the post-fire regeneration response for 41 coexisting species, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs, from an open Cerrado community (campo sujo) in Central Brazil. Location The study was conducted at the Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador (RNST) in Central Brazil. The vegetation of the study area is characterized by a continuous herbaceous layer dominated by grasses and scattered shrubs, which produces fine fuel loads that can burn frequently. Methods We examined both resprouting ability after experimental fires, accounting for bud location, and seed response to heat shocks caused by fire, where seeds were subjected to heat shocks of 100\textdegree C for one and three minutes, 200\textdegree C for one minute, and a control (untreated seeds). Results All species were able to resprout (R+) after fire, mainly from buds located in underground structures, but also from aerial and basal buds. Seeds of most species tolerated heat shocks of 100\textdegree C for one and three minutes, but heat treatments of 200\textdegree C decreased seed viability of nearly 50\% of species. Seven species, all of which had dormant seeds, showed heat-stimulated germination. In sum, 81\% of the community was classified as R+PT (resprouters with heat-tolerant propagules) and 17\% was R+PS (resprouters with heat-stimulated propagules). The remaining 2\% (one species) was classified as R+P-, showing heat-sensitive seeds. Conclusions Resprouting is the main post-fire regeneration strategy in Cerrado open savannas, while fire-stimulated germination, although possible, is less common in comparison to the frequency in other fire-prone ecosystems. However, in Cerrado open savannas, heat tolerance is an important trait that enables germination when favorable conditions arise.},
