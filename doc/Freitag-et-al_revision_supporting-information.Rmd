# Experimental design

We established a 2\*2 factorial experiment with seeding and soil disturbance 
in 73 grasslands. 
The four experimental treatments (control, seeding only, 
seeding and disturbance, disturbance only) each had a size of 7 m\*7 m and were arranged 
in a rectangle (or sometimes in a row, if the grassland shape or site 
characteristics did not allow for a rectangle) with 2 m distance between treatments. 
Within each of the treatments, we surveyed vegetation in one 2 m \* 2 m quadrat 
and sampled biomass each year in four 0.25 m^2^ squares (Fig. \@ref(fig:design)). 
We sampled biomass in different squares on the control each year
because sampled soil cores after biomass sampling in some years, 
which would have affected biomass samples in the following years. 
See [@klaus2017] for further details on the experimental design.

## Model formulas

### Plant species richness

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
Species\ richness_i \sim\ &\text{Poisson}(\mu_i),\ with\\
 \text{log}(\mu_{i}) =\ &\alpha + \beta_1 * Disturbance_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}

### S~PIE~

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
S_{PIE, i} \sim\ &\text{Gamma}(\mu_i,\phi)\\
 \text{log}(\mu_{i}) =\ &\alpha + \beta_1 * Disturbance_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}

\\
Grassland_j &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{Grassland})\\
RegionYear_k &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{RegionYear})\\
   \end{aligned}
   (\#eq:eq02)
\end{equation}
```
\

### Priors for the species richness and S~PIE~ models:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
\alpha &\sim \text{StudentT}(\nu = 3 ,\mu = 3, \sigma = 10)\\
\beta &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu = 0 ,\sigma = 2) \\
\tfrac{1}{\phi} &\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha = 0.01 ,\beta = 0.01) \\
\sigma_{Grassland} &\sim \text{StudentT}(\nu = 3 ,\mu = 3, \sigma = 10),\ \text{constrained to be positive}\\ 
\sigma_{RegionYear} &\sim \text{StudentT}(\nu = 3 ,\mu = 3, \sigma = 10),\ \text{constrained to be positive}\\ 
   \end{aligned}
   (\#eq:eq03)
\end{equation}
```

Because both species richness and S~PIE~ were modelled with log-link, we specified identical priors for $\beta$. 
$Disturbance_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}$, $seeding_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}$ and $year_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}$ are dummy variables for treatments and year for $Grassland_j$ and $RegionYear_k$
$Grassland_j$ is the grassland site grouping factor (73 grasslands) 
and $RegionYear_k$ is the region times year interaction grouping factor 
(three regions and five years).

$\Delta\ richness\ 1st\ year_i$ and $\Delta\ richness\ 5th\ year_i$ are the 
absolute differences in sown species richness 
(i.e. not considering unsown species when calculating richness)
the respective seeding treatment and the control, $Grazing_i$ is the mean 
grazing intensity (in livestock unit \* grazing days ha^-1^), $Mowing_i$ 
the mean number of cuts per year and $Fertilization_i$ is the mean 
amount of fertilizer applied (kg Nitrogen ha^-1^). $Region_{HAI}$ 
and $Region_{SCH}$ are dummy variables for the region, with $Region_{ALB}$ 
as the reference level.

$Biomass_{j{[}i{]}}$ is the harvested biomass (g m^-2^) of year $j$ in grassland site $i$ 
and $Productivity_i$ the latent 'true' productivity of 
grassland site $i$ with measurement error $\sigma$. $GrasslandMean_i$ 
and $GrasslandSD_i$ represent informed priors for $Productivity_i$, 
derived as the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the 
harvested biomass on grassland site $i$ across the five years of this study. 
All predictors were scaled to zero mean and unit SD to make effect sizes comparable.

We fitted models with $\Delta\ richness$ of total species richness 
(i.e., species richness including species which were not sown, 
such as ruderal species) using identical model specifications.

We coded $Establishment\ success_i$ as binary and assumed successful
establishment if the sown species has been recorded on the respective seeding 
treatment in the 5th year of the experiment.
$Live\ seeding\ density_{i{[}j{]}{[}k{]}}$ is the product of seed germination rate
and seeding density of species $j$ (dependent on seed mass, see Methods) in region $k$. 
$Height_{i{[}j{]}}$, $Seed mass_{i{[}j{]}}$ and $Specific\ leaf\ area_{i{[}j{]}}$ 
[from the LEDA Traitbase, @kleyer2008], 
$Productivity_{i{[}k{]}}$ and interactions of traits with productivity were used as predictors. 
We included varying intercepts for species $j$ ($Species_{i{[}j{]}}$) 
and grassland $k$ ($Grassland_{i{[}k{]}}$).
$Productivity_k$ was again modelled as latent as in the models on 
land-use effects on the number of established sown species.

grazing intensity (in livestock unit \* grazing days ha^-1^), $Mowing_i$ 
the mean number of cuts per year and $Fertilization_i$ is the mean 
amount of fertilizer applied (kg Nitrogen ha^-1^). $Region_{HAI}$ 
and $Region_{SCH}$ are dummy variables for the region, with $Region_{ALB}$ 
as the reference level.

$Biomass_{i,j}$ is the harvested biomass (g m^-2^) in grassland site $i$ 
and year $j$ and $Productivity_i$ the latent 'true' productivity of 
grassland site $i$ with measurement error $\sigma$. $GrasslandMean_i$ 
and $GrasslandSD_i$ represent informed priors for $Productivity_i$, 
derived as the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the 
harvested biomass on grassland site $i$ across the five years of this study. 
All predictors were scaled to zero mean and unit SD to make effect sizes comparable.

We fitted models with $\Delta\ richness$ of total species richness 
(i.e., species richness including species which were not sown, 
such as ruderal species) using identical model specifications.

as used in the models on trait and trait-productivity effects on species establishment.

## Model comparison of trait effects on establishment with grazing- and mowing-trait interactions

To investigate whether additional trait-environment interactions, i.e. interactions with grazing and mowing, influenced establishment, we modelled establishment with additional i) grazing and grazing-trait interactions, ii) grazing and grazing-trait interactions and iii) both grazing- and mowing-trait interactions as predictors. We used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) to compare model performances using the *loo* package [@vehtari2017; @vehtari2020].

The grazing- and mowing-trait interactions alone have weak effects on the establishment of sown species in both seeding treatments (Tables \ref{tab:trait-mow-graz-seed-only-table} and \ref{tab:trait-mow-graz-seed-disturb-table}). However, for the seeding only treatment the model including all productivity-, grazing- and mowing-trait interactions show additional positive effects of mowing and grazing intensity as well as a negative SLA\*grazing interaction. Despite, based on the LOO expected log pointwise predictive density for a new dataset (elpd~LOO~), we assume the predictive performance of models with grazing- and/or mowing-trait interactions to be equivalent to the predictive performance of the 'simplest' model with only productivity-trait interactions (Table \ref{tab:trait-mow-graz-comparison}). We therefore only report the results of the productivity-trait model in the main text to avoid the complex interpretation of both grazing- and mowing-trait interactions in the presence of productivity-trait interactions.

# Effects of region and resident species richness on $\Delta$richness

To test how $\Delta$richness relates to the resident species richness 
of the same site, we modelled $\Delta$richness with Gaussian errors 
as a function of region and resident species richness, which we log-transformed 
and scaled to unit SD. We specified weakly informative normal priors 
and default vague priors for the intercept. Increased $\Delta$richness 
was related to higher resident species richness in the fifth year in both, 
seeding only and seeding and disturbance, treatments 
(Fig. \@ref(fig:resident-richness), Table \@ref(tab:resident-richness-table)). 
We observed the highest increases in species richness through 
seeding and disturbance in already species-rich grasslands, 
whereas some species-poor grasslands did not gain any new species from either treatment.
