## **Response to reviewers**

**Manuscript JAPPL-2020-00916**

**Response to reviewers for manuscript entitled Restoration of permanent grasslands by seeding: assessing the limiting factors along land-use gradients**

<br>

**Associate Editor Comments**

We received three reviews from experts in grassland ecology and restoration. The reviewers were generally supportive of the manuscript and were impressed with the scope and experimental rigor of this study and its potential to contribute to grassland restoration, but also pointed out a number of concerns and areas where the study could be improved. In particular, they ask for clarification about aspects of the study design and interpretation of the results and make suggestions related to the statistical models and variables analyzed.

I suggest that the authors work carefully through this feedback, all of which I agree with. I would particularly urge the authors to dig further into interpretation of the seeded species, given the focus on plant establishment from seed and to consider whether different or additional variables beyond species richness and Shannon's diversity would be more appropriate, given the study's aims (see specific comments from Reviewers 2 and 3). Reviewer 3 also makes suggestions for how differences among sites in grazing, mowing, and productivity might be more fully considered. Please consider these suggestions, as they might allow for further exploitation of the substantial replication in this experiment.

**Response**:

Dear Dr. Brudvig, 

Thank you very much for your positive assessment and for the possibility to revise the manuscript JAPPL-2020-00916, 
to provide a clearer picture of land-use and productivity constraints on 
using diverse seed mixtures in grassland restoration.

We are excited to submit our revised manuscript *‘Restoration of permanent grasslands by seeding: assessing the limiting factors along land-use gradients’* for possible publication in Journal of Applied Ecology. 
We are very grateful for the thorough reviews, constructive comments and general support for this study.

In response to the comments did the following:

\ 

1. We clarified the experimental design and added a design figure to the appendix

2. We replaced the analysis of treatment effects on Shannon diversity with the 'effective number of species' S~PIE~ and added an analysis of land-use effects on the number of established *sown* species. 
Especially the new S~PIE~ analyses provide a more nuanced picture of seeding and disturbance treatments 
on diversity, as we now specifically discuss how decreases in evenness could have compensated increases in richness. 

3. We tested whether grazing and mowing intensities provide further insights 
into establishment from seeds and trait-environment interactions. 
We found that the inclusion of trait-grazing and trait-mowing did not add
important insight on how traits shape the establishment of sown species along
land-use and productivity gradients. 
Throughout the manuscript, we elaborated on the effects of land use
as well as unobserved drivers, such as litter, on establishment.

4. Thanks to the very helpful comments, we revised our conclusions
to provide more sensible recommendations for grassland restoration.

\ 

We feel the revisions have substantially improved the manuscript and its clarity. 
Below, you find our responses to the comments by the reviewers. 

Thanks to the constructive comments and suggested edits, 
we believe that the quality of this manuscript has improved substantially. 
Thank you for your consideration.

\ 

Sincerely,

Martin Freitag

(on behalf of all co-authors)

## Reviewers' Comments to the Authors


### Reviewer: 1


#### *Overall*

The manuscript is a solid contribution of the field with many spatial replicates and a well-designed and analysed full-factorial study setup. I had only some moderate to minor suggestions which needs to be treated in a revision.

**Response**:
Thank you very much for this positive evaluation and the helpful comments. 
Most importantly, in this revised manuscript we account for seeding densities
in the trait analyses and emphasized the uncertainty in predicting restoration success,
as several other site-specific factors, such as litter, 
could affect the establishment of sown species.


#### *Detailed comments*

1. l18-l20 There is a logical “break” between the two first sentences – no straight line of argumentation. Should be revised.

**Response**:
Thank you for pointing out this inconsistency. We revised the sentences which now read

*'(...) land-use intensification has caused dramatic declines in grassland biodiversity, and in Europe this decline has not yet been able to be halted by agri-environmental schemes. Therefore, a major challenge in ecological restoration is to effectively restore plant diversity in agricultural grasslands.'* (lines 19-22)


2. l35 “Plant traits affected sown species’ establishment” This assumption is somewhat misleading as not plant traits but species establish. Of course the trait composition of successfully establishing species might differ from that of poor performers. Please rephrase.

**Response**:
We absolutely agree and revised this sentence to

*'Functional traits structured the establishment of sown species, especially in the combined treatments, but effects varied with productivity. (...)'* (lines 36-37)


3. l92 This assumption was already mentioned by Török & Helm (2017), please cite it. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632071631103X

**Response**:
Thank you very much for pointing us toward this reference - it appears we have missed its importance during writing. We have added the reference. (line 98)


4. l99 we assessed how…

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.


5. l145-146 what about the standing litter and the litter layer?

**Response**:
We agree, high amounts of accumulated litter definitely could limit seedling emergence 
and recruitment due to reduced light availability (Loydi et al., 2013). 
Unfortunately, litter has not not been measured, which could be a limitation of our study.
However, especially standing litter is more relevant in dry grassland managed a low intensity 
while in regularly used grasslands such as the grasslands under study, 
litter rarely accumulates due to e.g. a cleaning cut after grazing in autumn (Gross et al., 2009). 
Thus, litter mass has not been measured in our study but only the cover of the litter layer was assessed. 
From our observations during field sampling, we are only aware of two grasslands 
(out of 73) which accumulated considerable amounts of litter due to very low management intensity. 
From our field observations we assume that litter on average constitutes only a small part 
of the aboveground biomass and the number of sites exhibiting significant litter 
is too low to allow for a statistical analysis of this factor. 
We therefore are confident that the living biomass 
(referred to as productivity) reasonably represents the effect of light competition 
on seedling recruitment in the grasslands under study. 

As mentioned above, we estimated the cover of the litter layer (and other layers) during field sampling.
To give an idea of litter cover and how it is affected by soil disturbance, 
we now display mean values of litter, bare soil and vegetation cover for the treatments 
over the study period in the appendix (Fig. S3). 
Note, however, that high litter cover does not imply a thick litter layer or high litter biomass, 
as we did not account for litter mass when estimating its cover. 
Additionally, the data suggests relatively strong observer effects on litter cover estimates.

We added a short discussion of the possible effects of litter on establishment 
in the discussion (see also comment 10):

*'Our results suggest that the success of establishment is generally low at productivity levels above ~250 g m^-2^ aboveground biomass in May, but the establishment probably still depends to a significant extent on further site characteristics. One such factor that determines seedling establishment might be litter biomass. While small amounts of litter can facilitate seedling recruitment in dry grasslands, dense litter (>500 g m-2) largely inhibits recruitment (Loydi, Eckstein, Otte, & Donath, 2013), However, we rarely observed high amounts of litter, which is typical for regularly used Central European grasslands (Gross et al., 2009).'* (lines 331-338)


6. l172 thus allowed…

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.


7. l248 The effectiveness of seeding depends on many factors including the level of site preparation, climate, nutrient and water availability, species composition, seeding density and the identity of species. Thus, there should be no overall recommendation on the seed sowing just so briefly.

**Response**:
Thank you very much for this suggestion. We agree that we have been a little bit 
too enthusiastic about using seeding only to increase species richness.
We have removed the recommendation to use seeding only from that section, 
discuss the low cover of sown species when disturbance was not applied (S~PIE~ results, lines 303-309),
but highlight that is remains an open question as to how long these differences
between seeding with and without prior soil disturbance persist (lines 311-313). 


8. l249 We showed that…

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.


9. l250-251 this is one of the benefits of a high diversity sowing (but not the seeding in general)

**Response**:
We have rewritten this first paragraph of the discussion and now focus
specifically on productivity as a major constraint in grassland restoration. (lines 289-293)


10. l290 This score strongly dependent how high was the litter accumulation – which was not measured. Some cases it can be that the green biomass is around 250g/m2 and same amount of litter (both standing and the litter layer) can be sampled. I think the litter is more important in shaping the richness-biomass relationship than the green biomass only.

**Response**:
Thank you very much for your comment on additional constraints for the successful establishment of sown species.
As concluded above (see comment 5), litter does not accumulate in the vast majority of grasslands 
included in this experiment (except maybe two). 
To acknowledge other factors that affect establishment success, 
we discuss the effects of litter (see comment 5, lines 331-338 in main text) and also discuss grazing and mowing effects (lines 339-345).
We have removed the mention of a 250 g m^-2^ 'threshold' from the abstract 
and first paragraph of the discussion, but shortly discuss the low establishment success at ~250 g m^-2^ aboveground biomass
to give an idea about the productivity levels.


11. l300 How were the seed mass/seed numbers reported to be in an inverse relationship – treated in the results? I.e. small seeded species with higher number/large seeded species in lower number? Also there are high differences in viability between seeded species – this is independent from leaf traits or plant height (I assume).
  
**Response**:
Thank you very much for emphasizing this design/analysis detail. 
Based on seed mass, we chose three seeding densities: 
100 seeds m^−2^ for seed mass < 1 mg, 34 seeds m^−2^ for seed mass between 1 mg 
and 10 mg and 17 seeds m^−2^ for seed mass > 10 mg (see also Klaus et al. 2017). 
In the initial version of the manuscript, we have not accounted for the effect of seeding density on 
the probability of establishment in the trait analysis. 

We now added seeding density as a categorical predictor in the trait analysis. 
Indeed, high seeding density had a positive effect on establishment. 
Accounting for seeding density slightly moved the seed mass effect on establishment
in the combined treatment towards zero,
but this did not affect overall conclusions about the effects of traits and
trait-productivity interactions on establishment. 

In fact, the interactive effect of seed mass \* productivity on the combined treatment
remained positive as in the original analysis
and seed mass had no clear effect on establishment for the seeding-only treatment 
with or without seeding density as predictor.
We now mention the seeding density effects in the methods and results 
sections and display all credible intervals in Table S4 in the appendix. 

Seed viability differed considerably between species. 
Prior the experiment, we tested the viability of the seed material and 
noted germination rates of 60 seeds per species for each region. 
There were weak negative correlations between germination rates 
and plant height and seed mass. 
We tested the trait models with germination rates included as a predictor, 
but the results did not change. 
Differences in viability were largely captured by the species-specific varying intercepts.

### Reviewer: 2


#### *Contributions* 

The authors have established a full-factorial restoration experiment 
with diverse seeding and topsoil disturbance in 73 grasslands along a land use 
and productivity gradient in three regions in Germany.
They measured the effects of treatments over five years. 
Both seeding and disturbance had positive effects on local species richness 
and Shannon’s diversity (scale: 4m2) with the strongest effect in the 
combined treatment of seeding and disturbance. 
There was no effect of land-use intensity found but fertilization 
indirectly limited the establishment of sown species in combined treatments 
via a negative effect of productivity.


#### *Strengths and Weaknesses*  

This is an impressive study. 
Questions are well posed, and analysis is designed to answer each question well.
Methodology for experimental design and data collection could be better explained.
Some parts of the analyses are confusing and unclear, and need to be
better/more clearly explained and presented.
The writing could be improved in some places,
the communication of results, and I think the visualization of results
have room for improvement as well.
I also would request some improvement in suggestions for management.
If this is all improved, I think the manuscript would be greatly improved as well.
Please see specific comments and concerns below.

**Response**:

Thank you for the critical assessment of our manuscript and the many helpful suggestion. 
We have now carefully revised all these (see below) and agree with the reviewer’s expectation 
in that doing so has considerably improved the manuscript.

Specifically, we have 

- clarified the experimental design and data collection and added a design figure to the appendix
- replaced Shannon diversity by S~PIE~ and revised the results section and visualization for this analysis
- adapt the very helpful suggestions for management recommendations

We were very happy to receive such positive feedback and numerous detailed comments
with very clear suggestions for improvement. 
Lastly, we used the manuscript editing service from the University of Münster.
Thanks to your and the other reviewer's comments, we feel that the manuscript has indeed greatly improved.




#### *Abstract and Intro*

12. L 20- I am not sure what you mean by permanent grasslands and I wonder if this is the best term

**Response**:
Thank you for asking for clarification. 
We were searching for a term which spans the full range from species-rich 'semi-natural grasslands' 
to frequently mown and highly fertilized meadows used for silage production. 
We agree that 'permanent grassland' might not have been the best choice 
and changed this term to 'agricultural grasslands', a term used in previous papers 
of the Biodiversity Exploratories project grasslands 
(e.g. Allan et al. 2015 EcolLett, https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12469).


13. L29- here I’d say along a gradient

**Response**:
Revised to

*'(...) after five years we assessed the number of established species along gradients of land-use intensity and productivity  (...)'* (lines 29-30)


14. L 42- 46- I think there’s some important points here, but I am not sure what you mean so I think the sentences could be re-written

**Response**:
Thank you very much for your suggestions to improve the management recommendations. 
We fully revised the *Synthesis and applications* part (lines 40-46), 
and we found your suggestions to reconsider the recommendations most helpful. 


15. L45-46-particularly I’m not sure about this conclusion. A focus on low productivity grassland generally for restoration seems an odd and not very compelling management recommendation- perhaps in cases where disturbance cannot be applied? Id recommend thinking more about management implications for this study in terms of **how you would go about restoring grassland productive or unproductive - we often don’t get to choose the land we are given to restore**. Sites can be prioritized for resources for treatments, or certain strategies can be taken on certain sites. In your discussion, your points about stopping fertilization seem more tangible and practical

**Response**:
We found your suggestions for the management recommendations very helpful and
revised this section accordingly (see also comment 15 above). 
Specifically, we recommend 

*'(...) taking measures to first stop fertilization and reduce productivity in highly productive grasslands. Restoration by seeding, with or without disturbance, should only be applied when the productivity is at an appropriate level (...)'* (lines 43-46)


16. Also- what’s a low-competitive sowing species, and how to you check if it matches the resident vegetation? Don’t we want highly competitive species (can you tell via traits?) or what do you mean specifically here?

**Response**:
We obviously didn't make clear enough what we meant here.
Possibly, 'match the resident vegetation' was too vague. We now wrote:

*'(...) the local environment should be considered to compile site-specific seed mixtures to maximise restoration success.'* (lines 46-47)



17. L65- I am not sure I would describe hay transfer as elaborate or applying commercially available seeds as being relatively easy in comparison to hay transfer. I think there are other arguments for commercial mixes that might be better suited to the context of your study; lack of appropriate hay sources, ineffectiveness of hay applications, or knowing the composition of a seed mixture to be able to tailor outcomes or measure success against known treatments are a few.

**Response**:
Thank you for the suggestions. We have revised the text as suggested:

*'(...) but this practice (hay transfer) is often constrained by appropriate donor sites, low transfer rates of species with particular early or late phenology or delayed establishment caused by seed dormancy (Wagner, Hulmes, Hulmes, Redhead, et al., 2020). Hay transfer can be supplemented or replaced by commercially available seeds of regional provenance, as diverse seeding enables one to tailor the species composition to a target community. '* (lines 66-70)


18. L73- you could also cite the regeneration niche here

**Response**:
Revised as suggested, we added Grubb et al. 1977 as a reference.


19. L77- its unclear what you mean by ‘its practical relevance’ here- the disturbance? Or are you changing topics to land-use?

**Response**:
Thank you for pointing this out. We were referring to restoration of regularly used, 
possibly productive and species-poor grasslands. 
However, we have completely revised this part (lines 80-91) 
and elaborated more on the effects of grazing and 
mowing (see also comment 50).


20. L81- This paragraph changes topics a few times and sentences are not well connected. I recommend to try a re-write in line with a topic sentence and closing sentence that leads to the next paragraph

**Response**:
Thank you very much for this suggestion, we rewrote this paragraph 
to outline the advantage of selecting and adding species that match local site conditions (lines 92-102).


21. L96- a few times you say ‘high-productive’ or ‘low-productive’ – which is a bit awkward- it could be changed for- ‘highly-productive’ or ‘high-productivity’ or ‘low-productivity’

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.


22. L102-107- remove bullet points and put into sentences

**Response**:
Revised as suggested


23. L106 – the establishment of sown species

**Response**:
Revised as suggested



#### *Methods*

24. L111- I’d say as a part of the biodiversity exploratories project/platform

**Response**:
Revised as suggested


25. L-112- and productivity?

**Response**:
Here (now line 120), we referred to the three regions, which span gradients in soil characteristics, elevation and climate. 
Later, we describe the selected grasslands within regions and added a mention of the productivity gradients:

*'Within each region, we selected 23-25 agricultural grasslands along gradients of land-use intensity, productivity and corresponding plant diversity (...)'* (lines 126-128)


26. L116- is iii) acidic soils?

**Response**:
Thank you for spotting this. The Schorfheide region mainly has slightly acidic sandy soils and drained fens. We added *'slightly acidic sandy soils'* to the description. (lines 124-126)


27. L121- what’s a ‘mown improved grassland’? try to be more descriptive to a non-european audience where this is not well-understood as a standard

**Response**:
We revised the description to:

*'(...) ranging from unfertilized sheep pastures with 80 plant species per 16 m^2^ to highly fertilized, productive and frequently mown meadows with 10 plant species per 16 m^2^.'* (lines 128-129)

28. L125- plots were 7m x 7m, and then sample level measurements within them are referred to as subplots? And are 2m by 2m? detail that here. Were there replicates within the 7mx7m plot? These were what were arranged in a row- or- what does arranged within a quadrat mean? Weren’t the quadrats placed within the plots? These details should be described more carefully and all together rather than broken up over paragraphs. – what I am getting at, is that it sounds like the measured subplots were clustered together, in a semi randomized (?) block design, but to understand I need the details of this, and also how these treated plots relate to the controls are also of interest. Where were the control plots located? Particularly, because you report the change in richness as it differs from controls.

**Response**:
Thank you for these important comments. We were indeed not consistent 
with the grassland, plot and subplot terms.
We now added a design figure to the appendix to visualize the arrangement 
of treatments, vegetation survey and biomass sampling (Fig. S1) and consistently 
refer to 'grasslands', four experimental 'treatments' within each grassland
and a vegetation survey 'quadrat' in each 'treatment' throughout the manuscript.

We changed the text to:

*'We established a 2 \* 2 factorial experiment with seeding and topsoil disturbance in 73 grasslands. This resulted in four 7 m \* 7 m treatments (control, seeding only, seeding and disturbance, disturbance only), which we arranged in a rectangle with 2 m distance between treatments (see appendix S1).'* (lines 133-135)

For some grasslands we had to arrange the treatments in a row due to grassland 
shape or other properties (for instance a cattle trampling path or a small depression).
To avoid confusion, we moved the note on treatments arranged in a row to the appendix.

However, as we first describe the seeding and topsoil disturbance, which constitute the experimental treatments,
and because the vegetation surveys started after the setup of the experiment, 
we describe the vegetation and biomass sampling two paragraphs later:

*'On all four 7 m \* 7 m treatments in each of the 73 grasslands, we recorded all vascular plant species on 2 m \* 2 m quadrats and estimated their percentage cover. As a proxy for competition in the grasslands, annually we clipped all living plant biomass on one square meter (four 0.25 m^2^ squares, different places each year) on the control treatments'* (lines 152-153)

We hope that the experimental design is now clearer.



29. L139- no legumes available in this region, make it clear to international readers that this refers to commercial seed according to German regional seed use regulations

**Response**:
We clarified that 
*'we used commercially available regional seed mixtures from certified seed producers, which are assumed to be adapted to regional environmental conditions (Bucharova et al., 2017).'* (lines 142-14) and noted that *'no regional seeds of legumes available from seed producers for'* the Schorfheide region (line 150).



30. L145- was the biomass always clipped in the same spot or did this spot differ every year, was this kept track of in a particular way?

**Response**:
We clipped biomass in four squares each year on the control treatment, 
each year in different places due to destructive soil sampling after biomass sampling 
in some years (see the experimental design figure in the Appendix Fig. S1).
We changed the text in the methods section to: 

*'(...) annually we clipped all living plant biomass on one square meter (four 0.25 m^2^ squares, different places each year) on the control treatment'* (lines 154-155)



31. L151- Shannon’s diversity is problematic for a few reasons I suggest you use a different or add a complimentary measure to explore the effect of treatments on biodiversity- eg. inverse shannons, inverse simpsons (ENSpie), especially given the gradients explored here, even when the scale of measurement is the same richness or shannons can be misleading, and ENSpie/Spie can offer a consistent check, and tell us something new as well. Instead of abundance you can use relative cover. Given the difference between richness and shannons estimates, and differences between sites and regions, this would be valuable.  
See:  
Jost, L (2006) Entropy and Diversity, Oikos  
Chase, Knight (2013) Scale-dependent effect sizes of ecological drivers on biodiversity: why standardised sampling is not enough, Ecology Letters

**Response**: Thank you very much for this suggestion, we really liked the idea 
to examine the treatment effects on S~PIE~ instead of the Shannon index. 
This gives us the possibility to interpret with more detail the effects 
of both seeding and disturbance on diversity with a higher weighting of community evenness. 
As expected, the S~PIE~ analysis suggests weaker effects of the seeding treatments 
on diversity compared to species richness, yet the seeding and disturbance treatment 
still showed a moderate increase in diversity. 
Compared to the analysis of the Shannon index in the previous version of this manuscript, 
the effects are weaker because the Shannon weighs abundant and rare species equal, 
while S~PIE~ weighs abundant species more than rare species (Jost 2006).
We replaced the Shannon index with the S~PIE~ in the main text, 
in part also because a recent meta analysis of seeding effects on plant diversity 
used the same S~PIE~ metric (Ladouceur et al. 2020: Reducing dispersal limitation 
via seed addition increases species richness but not above-ground biomass, *Ecology Letters* **23**, 1442-1450.)


32. L165- a brief statement why and for what and where this was used is needed.

**Response**:
Changed to

*'(...) and we calculated conditional and marginal Bayes R^2 (Gelman et al., 2019) to asses how much variation is explained by the treatments.'* (lines 181-183)

33. L204- the plant traits models were multivariate?  
In order to reason using control plot biomass to explain seeding success in disturbed plots where biomass was largely removed (figures 3, 4, 5) as a direct effect, you need to set this up why this is a reasonable expectation (competition).

**Response**:
Thank you for your suggestion. In the introduction, we clarified that productivity 
is an indicator of competition for light in the years after disturbance (lines 80-84)
and added short statements on the use of productivity in the analysis section (for instance lines 219-220). 


Regarding the trait models: 
The trait models were not multivariate in the sense of the simultaneous modelling of 
response variables measured on the same experimental unit.
We modelled productivity as latent (i.e. latent productivity *caused* the observed biomass weights of five year)
and used productivity as a predictor for establishment. 
We carefully revised the model formulas of all analyses in the appendix 
and refer to the formulas in the methods section.



#### *Results*

34. For each result, please put the effect size followed by the credible intervals for each effect eg. (2.5 90% CI : 1.5 to 3.1). I would put table 1 in the supplementary information. The current format of reporting results eg. L212 (plus 9.3 species and 38% in the fifth year) can be used as the plain English explanation for this result, which will make it more clear. Eg. this means that plots treated with seeds increased by 9.3 species or 38% compared to controls.

**Response**:
Revised as suggested, we now report effect sizes as '$beta$=0.04, 90% CrI: -0.0 to 0.1'.


35. I find your axis label and explanation in the figure caption of change in richness to imply that this is the effect size as it differs from the control (the raw estimate model output for each population level effect), but then when I examined table s1 I realise this is not the case – it’s the additive effect of control + treatment. Maybe change in richness is still appropriate given how you’ve modelled, but I’m still finding it hard to understand and seems a bit convoluted for the questions. Better explanations and of these details is required a least in the supplement and the figures axes and captions should help to understand. Looking at table S1, I cannot understand where the values have come from in Figure 1a  iii) (3rd panel). I understand these effect sizes are additive now, but I cannot come up with a scenario in which these are the reported effects. Even if I’ve misunderstood, needs to be made clearer to the reader in some way. I find it odd the intercept estimate is so high, maybe this is due to how you’ve modelled with time as a factor. Any explanations for this?

**Response**:
Thank you very much for pointing out difficulties in the interpretation of this figure. 
We obviously did not make clear that the treatment effects in Fig. 1 are 
displayed on the response scale (Number of species 4 m^-2^), while species richness  
was modelled as Poisson distributed with log-link.
Parameter estimates reported in Table S1 therefore are on the log scale 
with base $e$, and the intercept refers to the mean species richness 
on the control treatment in the first year, which is $e$^3.18^ = 24.1 species per 4 m^2^.

To improve the figure according to he reviewers comment, 
we have added the additive parameter effects (on the log scale, panel a)
to display the seeding and disturbance treatment effect sizes. 
For the panels (b) to (g), we we used the posterior samples to predict species richness
for the treatments and three regions over time,
including the intercept, the three-way-interactions seeding\*disturbance\*year
and the region:year varying intercepts.
We transformed the predicted values to the response scale 
and subtracted the predicted values of the control 
from the predicted values of the respective treatment, 
then summarized the median and 90% credible intervals).

We changed the y axis label to *'Difference in species richness/S~PIE~ (Treatment - Control +- p90% CrI)'*,
clarified the use of response-scale effects and the calculation of the differences to the control in the figure caption:

*'(...) Both diversity measures were modelled with log-link assuming Poisson and Gamma error structure, respectively. Panels (b) to (g) display differences between treatments and the control on the response scale. (...) To calculate differences between treatments and control, we predicted species richness and S_{PIE} based on additive parameter effects (a), transformed predicted values to the response scale and calculated the difference in predicted values between treatments and control. (...)'* (caption Fig. 1, lines 566-576)


36. I’d like to see the fit of the data to predicted values for each model in the supplementary information. I’d also like the effective sample sizes and the Rhats for each reported there.

**Response**:
We added posterior-predictive checks for all models to the appendix 
and included effective sample sizes for all parameters in the appendix tables. 
Since Rhats were below 1.01 for all estimated parameters, we did not include
Rhats in the tables but noted Rhats in each table captions (see tables in the appendix).


#### *Discussion*

37. L258-269- It gets a bit off topic here, you’ve investigated a lot of specific things here, I suggest to stick to discussing those related topics that are directly relevant
  
**Response**:
Thank you for the suggestion. We largely removed this part, where we discussed possible applications of using seeding only for restoration. 


#### *Figures*

38. Generally, I’d love to see a little more attention to detail and consistency across figures with the data visualizations. The axes labels could use more consistent and detailed labelling.

**Response**:
Thank you very much for the detailed suggestions to improve the figures.
We have incorporated all suggested changes, see comments below.

 


39. Figure 1 – label boxes within a and b and i), ii) and iii)

**Response**:
Revised as suggested, now each box (instead of each row) is labelled with letters.


40. Figure 3- make the line for the overall effect thicker than the colored lines for each region

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.


41. Figure 4 - you could put an inset plot for each effect in the top right hand corner of each panel of figure 5 instead of this being a stand alone plot. I would like to see each effect size next to the slope.

**Response**:
We really liked this suggestion, which saved one figure.
For each inset plot we specified the same x axis limits, 
such that the effect sizes can be compared across the facets.


42. Table 1- I would move this to the appendix and report the most important results (in relation to each question) in the results section of the text

**Response**:
Thank you for the suggestion. We moved this table to the appendix (Table S2)
and added the credible intervals to the figures.



43. Figure S1 - This is the opposite result of what I would expect. How does resident species richness (16m2) relate to the productivity gradient?  And- what about at the 4m2 scale? I think you need to consider the productivity gradient here because if more productive sites are less biodiverse than this would explain…….

**Response**:
Generally, productivity and species richness are negatively correlated in the
grasslands under study (see e.g. Socher et al., 2012). 
The positive association between resident species richness and the number of 
established species suggests that both are constrained by the same factor: productivity.
In terms of priority effects, we could also conclude that high resident species richness
does not limit the available niche space for new species through niche pre-emption (Fukami 2015, Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst),
but resident richness rather correlates with overall available niche space in unsaturated communities.

To address this comment, we now highlight the association between productivity and both resident richness 
and the number of established species in the discussion. 
Both species richness on the 16 m^2^ scale and the 4 m^2^ were equally strong correlated
with the number of established species. For the Figure in the appendix, 
we switched to resident richness on 4 m^2^ as predictor, which supported the same conclusion.

The part of the discussion now reads:

*'(...) Concurrently, the number of established species correlated positively with the resident species richness (see appendix S6), both of which are constrained by productivity (Socher et al., 2012). Thus, productivity limits both resident species richness and the establishment of introduced species, indicating that both species richness and the potential to introduce new species decrease with higher fertilization, which increases productivity.'* (lines 323-327)

### Reviewer: 3

#### *Major comments*

This study presents the results of a factorial experiment manipulating 
seeding and topsoil disturbance across 73 European grasslands.
The authors show that the combination of disturbance and seeding 
can increase species richness and diversity. 
They also show how functional traits and their interaction with site productivity 
affects rates of species establishment.  
The strengths of this manuscript are the use of a large number of sites considered, 
the direct manipulation of both seeding and disturbance, 
the use of functional traits to evaluate establishment, 
and the inclusion of trait by environment interactions.  
Given these strengths, I think that this work could represent a useful contribution to the literature; 
however, I had several concerns that I think currently limit this potential.

**Response**:

Thank you very much for the very positive evaluation. 
We were happy to receive such positive feedback and helpful suggestions,
especially to analyse and discuss grazing and mowing effects on establishment 
more in depth as in the original version of the manuscript.


44. It looks like the SCH region is more productive than either the HAI or ALB regions. 
It might be useful to see the distribution of productivity by region. 
Also, how might the variation in productivity by region influence the model? 
Consider discussing this.

**Response**:

While in Fig. 3 we display productivity linearly on the x axis, 
we used the log-transformed productivity as predictor in all analyses.
To display the distribution of productivity and other predictors 
(on the scale as they were used in the analyses), 
we added plots of density distributions to the appendix (Fig. S4)
along with pairs plots and correlations between predictors.
Although the Schorfheide region was more productive
than the other regions, the distributions still overlap to a large degree on the log scale,
such that we do not expect a large influence of predictor distributions on the model
that are not captured by the region effect. 

Other than the potential issue with the mentioned productive sites, 
three grasslands in the ALB region had a particular low productivity on the log scale. 
To test whether those observations were highly influential, 
we rerun the two analyses (land-use effects on the number of established species
and trait-environment effects on binary establishment, see comment 51) 
without those three grasslands.
Concerning land use and productivity effects on the number of 
established species (sown species $\Delta$richness).
Particularly, the negative effect of productivity on sown species $\Delta$richness 
persisted for the seeding and disturbance treatment 
and become clearer on the seeding-only treatment when the three Alb grasslands were removed.

Thus, we conclude that our models are robust to differences in productivity distributions
in the three regions.



45. Throughout the paper the idea that disturbance might create microsites for seeded species is eluded to. However, tilling the soil may also cause a flush of ruderal non-sown species 
that were not seen in control plots. 
This seems somewhat unlikely given that disturbance alone did not have a large effect on richness. 
However, it would be useful to know the proportion of species richness 
that was due to sown species vs other species. 
Consider rerunning the models with only sown species richness. 
This is worth discussing in the manuscript.

**Response**:
Thank you very much or the suggestion to focus on the establishment of sown species.
We rerun the models of land-use and productivity effects on the number of established species
and display the differences between sown species richness and 'total' species richness.
Indeed, the increase in richness in the first year was to a certain degree also driven 
by an increase in ruderal species when seeding was combined with disturbance (Fig. 2). 
However, in the fifth year, the contribution of unsown species got much smaller (Fig. 2,
also supported by field observations of ruderal species cover and community composition). 
While the overall conclusions remained the same (no effects of grazing or mowing),
the models explained the differences in only sown species richness slightly better,
as indicated by larger R^2^'s (Table S2 and S3).

Besides emphasizing the relevance of microsites in several places in the text
we also mention the contribution of ruderal species in the discussion, e.g.: 

*'(...) Concurrent with previous research, disturbing the topsoil reduced microsite limitations and created safe regeneration spaces for the seeded species to establish (Bischoff, Hoboy, Winter, & Warthemann, 2018; Grubb, 1977; Münzbergová & Herben, 2005). (...)'* (lines 298-301)

*'(...) the intensively used productive grasslands benefited most from seeding and disturbance (Klaus et al., 2017), but initial increases in species richness were partly driven by ruderal species from the soil seed bank (...)'* (lines 315-317)




46. Related to the previous comment. Do you see the loss of any species with the tilling treatment?

**Response**:

Possible negative effects of topsoil disturbance on 'target' or even sown species richness
could be masked by an increase in ruderal species, such as *Thlaspi arvense*, 
*Capsella bursa-pastoris* and *Polygonum aviculare*.
However, in the first year of the experiment Klaus et al. (2017) only find a weak, 
non-significant negative effect of tilage on 'typical grassland species' richness 
(arable weeds excluded, Klaus et al., 2017, Tables 1 and 2).

Concurrently, an analysis of treatment effects on sown species richness and S~PIE~ over time
suggests only a small negative effect of disturbance on sown species richness (excluding ruderal species), 
but this effect has already vanished in year two (see disturbance only treatment in Figure below).

```{r treatment-sown-species, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = capsownspecies, echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/01_fitted_diversity-sown-species.png")
capsownspecies <- "Effects of seeding and disturbance over time on plant species richness
and S_{PIE}. In this anlysis, only sown (or 'target') species were used to calculate
species richness and S_{PIE} to test for possible negative effects of disturbance
on 'target' species. Points show the median and lines display the 90\\% credible interval of posterior samples."
```

We assume that the aboveground parts of some species were destroyed by 
rotovating the topsoil, leading to a small and temporary negative effect of disturbance 
on plant diversity in the first year, but the data suggests that 'target/sown' species richness quickly 
recovered. 
However, as we have no information on the species composition prior disturbance 
and the fact that the analysis of treatment effects on 'target' species richness over time 
does not add new evidence on top of Klaus et a., (2017), 
we did not include an analysis of disturbance effects on 'target' species richness.


47. Consider how grazing and mowing affect seedling establishment through interaction with traits. Why not consider grazing and mowing when modeling how traits affect establishment? Specifically include trait by grazing and trait x mowing interactions.

**Response**:
Thank you very much for suggestion that not only trait-productivity,
but also trait-grazing and trait-mowing interactions should be 
taken into account. 
Initially, we did not consider grazing and mowing in the trait-based
establishment analyses, because grazing and mowing had no effect
on the number of established species (sown species $\Delta$richness analyses).
However, the identity of established species could indeed due to grazing and mowing intensities.
To test for the importance of grazing and mowing for trait-based establishment,
we fitted three additional models with i) trait-grazing interactions, 
ii) trait-mowing interactions and iii) both trait-grazing and trait-mowing interactions
in addition to the trait-productivity interactions.

The trait-grazing and trait-mowing models suggest fairly weak effects of 
trait-grazing- and trait-mowing interactions 
in the presence of trait-productivity interactions, 
only when we included both trait-grazing and trait-mowing we found some effects (Tables S5 and S6),
In all models, productivity and trait-productivity interactions still have considerable effects. 
These results could partly be driven by a negative correlation between grazing and mowing,
as grasslands are rarely both heavily grazed and frequently mown (see appendix Fig. S4).
These results concur with our results from the effects of direct and indirect effects 
of land use on the number of established species, where mowing and grazing
had no clear effects on establishment while accounting for the effect of 
productivity, even when we omitted one of the grazing or mowing predictors from the model.

To judge whether including grazing- and mowing-interactions improves
the prediction of establishment success, we compared the models based on 
leave-one-out cross-validation (Vehtari, Gabry, Yao, & Gelman, 2020; Vehtari, Gelman, & Gabry, 2017). 
According to these analyses, accounting for trait-grazing and trait-mowing effects did not improve the 
predictive performance and the model with only trait-productivity
interactions appeared to perform best (Table S7).
Because of model performance, but also because interpretation becomes
more complex with more trait-environment interactions in one model,
we decided to report the 'smaller' and 'simpler' model with only 
trait-productivity interactions in the main text.

We describe the comparison of models with and without trait-grazing and 
trait-mowing interactions in the methods section and report our findings 
that including trait-grazing and trait-mowing interactions did not considerably improve 
our predictions of seedling establishment in the results (see below).
We further elaborate on the importance of grazing and mowing 
on establishment (while accounting for productivity) in the discussion 
(see comments 49 and 50).

*'(...) Informed by a negative effect of productivity on the number of established species, we initially included productivity (log-transformed, as a measure of competition) and interactions of traits with productivity. (...) To test for trait-grazing and trait-mowing effects, we fitted three additional models (...)'* (lines 218-223)

*'We tested for additional trait-grazing and trait-mowing interactions on establishment but based on leave-one out cross-validation, neither interaction improved the prediction of establishment success (appendix Table S7).'* (lines 273-275)



48. What does the variation in grazing and mowing look like across sites? Would it make sense to model the response as a yes or no grazing and mowing if there are a large number of sites without grazing or mowing?

**Response**:
One advantage of performing this experiment in the Biodiversity Exploratories 
project is that the chosen grasslands represent real-world gradients of land-use intensity. 
Hence, the land-use components grazing, fertilization and mowing
also differ considerably in their intensity and constitute large gradients 
from light to intensive grazing and one to three
cuts per year. There are, for instance, mown pastures with 
one cut in June and intensive grazing from July on, single-cut meadows
with light sheep grazing during a few days in December, or meadows
with three cuts per year and intensive fertilization. 
For some grasslands, the grazing and mowing intensities even vary significantly between years-
Therefore, we are not able to categorize the grasslands into pastures and meadows.

To display grazing and mowing intensities (and productivity, 
see also comment 44), we display the distribution of grazing, mowing and 
mean aboveground biomass by region in appendix S4. 




49. It would be reasonable that grazing and mowing could create microsites for seeded species to establish, the mechanism implied here. So, it is interesting if grazing and mowing have no effect. Do sites with more grazing or mowing have more bare ground (potential microsites)? This should be possible to look at with the cover data. Consider discussing why you see no effect of grazing or mowing on species richness.

**Response**:
To be honest, we were also surprised that grazing had no effects on establishment.
We can only speculate that maybe strong productivity effects outperform grazing or mowing effects,
or grazing and mowing really have only little effect.
In our data, we don't see clear associations between bare soil cover and mowing or grazing (Fig. S9).
We tested whether excluding grazing or mowing from the model them changed the results, 
but grazing and mowing still had no clear effects.
We conclude that grazing and mowing really have no effect, and describe this in the discussion:

*'Interestingly, grazing and mowing had no effect on the number of established species. Grazing is assumed to create microsites by feeding and trampling and, hence, increasing the recruitment from seeds (e.g. Kladivová & Münzbergová, 2016), but effects of grazing on establishment are usually low (Maccherini & Santi, 2012; Rasran, Vogt, & Jensen, 2007) (...)'* (lines 339-342)



50. Currently there is no discussion of grazing or mowing in the introduction or discussion sections. It is not clear why grazing and mowing might influence richness or establishment. Are these factors simply to control for variation in the model? Is the mechanism for how they affect richness/establishment the same as for topsoil disturbance? If so, why do we see no significant effect. Consider elaborating on these two processes if they are included in the manuscript.

**Response**:
Thank you for pointing this out. 
We have elaborated on the effects of grazing and mowing on 
microsites for establishment in the introduction (lines 83-88) 
and expanded the discussion (lines 339-346, see comment 49 above).


51. Figure 5: When showing portions of the interaction surface, which is useful for simplifying the visualization of complex interactions, it is worth including figures with the full surface with data points plotted on it in the supplement. For example, the SCH region had many of the high productivity sites but also had no legumes sown which often have very large seeds. This may result in having no data in the high productivity by high seed mass portion of the interaction surface. In this case the interaction between productivity and seed mass may be driven by a lack of data not a difference in seed mass. Plotting the interaction surfaces would be useful for checking the distribution of data across each of the plotted interactions.

**Response**:
We agree that the interaction parameters could be vulnerable to highly influential observations,
when the combination of trait-environment predictors are not evenly distributed.
We added pairs plots of predictors (traits and productivity) to the appendix
to visualize the distribution of and relationships between predictors (Fig. S6).
The figure shows sufficient distribution of trait by trait and 
trait by productivity distributions, which means that the results are robust.

There are, however, three grassland in the ALB region which have very low productivity
on the log scale (see also comment 44). To test whether these grasslands have extraordinarily 
high influence on the model results, we rerun the models without the 
three grasslands with very low productivity.
The parameter credible intervals were very close to the results from the initial 
model. But for the seeding and disturbance treatment, 
the seed mass-productivity interaction turned from clearly positive 
(median 1.72, 90% CrI: 0.7 to 2.9) to fairly positive (median 1.02, 90% CrI: -0.5 to 2.6). 
To check whether this is caused by highly influential observations from 
the three grasslands, we performed leave-one-out cross-validation 
to obtain the Pareto *k* diagnostics of Pareto smoothed importance sampling 
('loo()' function from the *loo* package, Vehtari et al., 2017, Vehtari et al., 2019: http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646). 
The Pareto *k* diagnostic can be used as a measure of the observation's influence on
the posterior distribution of the model, and is good if *k* < 0.5 
and ok if *k* < 0.7 (Vehtari et al., 2017). In the models including all observations, 
*k* was always below 0.5 for the observations from the three Alb grasslands 
with very low productivity. 
Based on only small changes in credible intervals after excluding the
three grasslands and based on the pareto *k* diagnostic, 
we are confident our results are robust.



#### *Minor comments*

52. Line 286: “Here, productivity is mainly a result of soil fertility” Fertilization was the only factor in the productivity model correct? So nothing else could have an effect on productivity, except region which does show a significant effect. Is it plausible that there are other factors that could drive productivity that were not accounted for here?

**Response**:

We are afraid this phrase was poorly worded. We have revised the sentence (see below)
to emphasize that productivity is one, but in intensively used grasslands an important
driver of productivity. 
There are a lot of site and soil characteristics that affect productivity, 
such as groundwater level, soil texture and water-holding capacity and plant-available nitrogen.
However, we did not incorporate these factors in the productivity model
because these relationships vary greatly between but also within regions. 
The effects of soil properties were beyond our scope, as we focussed on land use.

*'Several studies have emphasized that soil fertility and its determinant role for productivity as one of the most important constraints to restoring species-rich grasslands (Dickson & Foster, 2008; Walker et al., 2004), and fertilization significantly contributes to this constraint.'* (lines 328-330)



53. Table S1 & S2: Consider making credible intervals that do not overlap zero bold as in Table 1.

**Response**:
Revised as suggested.
